00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:19.100
Today we are going to learn about Binary Digits.
Hands up if you've heard of a thing called
a bit in a computer. Have you heard of a bit?

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:30.900
A bit comes from binary digits. We take the first letter of binary and add the last bit of digit and we shorten it to bits.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.600
Right now we've got five bits standing up
here. Let's see what that means.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.020
I'm going to give you the number 1, you're
going to be a bit that represents 1 dot.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.530
You're going to be a bit that represents 2
dots.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.600
What's the next number? Call it out. (4, 3)

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.600
Hands up if you think 3. That's our counting system.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.800
Let's see if you are right with binary. Oh! It's 4.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:07.800
What could be the next number? Yes? (6 or 5).
It could be 6 or 5. It's actually 8.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.400
What's happening with those numbers? What's the next number Oliver? (16) Is he right?

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.500
What's the next number after 16 then? Jacob (32) Oh, what comes after 32?

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.100
(136) Could be, what else could it be? Lachlin (64) Is he right? (yes).

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:42.300
What's the next number that comes after 64? Thomas (128) After that? Jacob? (256) There we go.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:53.000
Does anyone know what the next one is? Ben. (512) So when we... What's the next one Jacob?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.950
So with only a few bits we can count up really
high, right?

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:07.070
If we look at this we can count 1, 2, 4, 8,
16 dots.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:20.600
Let's look at what that means inside a computer. A bit can be on or it can be off. So this bit can be on or it can be off.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.900
Now what I want you guys to do is think of a number between 31 and 1. Hands up if you thought of a number. Ben, what number (12).

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:40.200
12 What we want to do is look at these dots and show 12 dots in binary. Do we want 16 on or off? (off). Turn off please.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:53.500
If we are making the number 12 do we want 8 on or off? (on) OK, how many's left over then? (4) Do we want 4 dots on or off? (on).

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:04.000
What about 2? (off) Why? Why is 2 getting turned off? (Because You've already made 12 with the 8 and 4). So 1 stays on or ...? (off)

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:16.100
Who can tell me in binary what 12 would be, representing 12? Who wants to have a go? (off, on, on, off, off) Thumbs up if you agree.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.850
What about Elarn, do you want to make, can you guys all turn yourselves back on again,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.400
Elarn, choose a number that we are going to make. (24) 24 Can you just turn yourself back on please.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:45.670
For 24 do we want 16 on or off? (on) 8 on
or off (on) 4, (off) 2 (off) 1 (off).

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:53.769
Elarn, what is binary for 24 dots? (on, on,
off, off, off).

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.400
Could we make the number 1 for me. How would we do that?

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:08.000
How would we make the number 1? (black, black, black, black, white) Can you guys make that?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.700
Now that you've seen the number 1 is there
another number you can think of that would be even lower than 1? Will?

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.700
(0) How would you make 0? (turn off the white one).

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:38.000
We can make the lowest number zero and the
highest number, if you turn on all your cards back on, with five bits, what's the highest
number we can represent? Ben? (31) Hands up if you agree with Ben? It is 31.

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:49.300
If we can make 31 what's the next card going to be? If I join this and become the sixth bit what's
the next number? (32) 32.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:05:00.000
If I turn on 32 these guys all have to turn (off)
off to make 32. If you guys all turn off.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.879
Let's do some counting and see what happens
with the different bits.

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:12.600
We've got zero. What do we need to do to make 1? Yes, give the instructions (turn on 1).

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:23.800
2, how do we make 2? Tell the people (turn off 1, turn on 2) 3? Lachlin, go (turn 1 on and keep 2 on).

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:43.500
4? (turn 2 and 1 off and turn 4 on) 5? (turn 1 on...)
What are you noticing about the first bit?

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.000
Zander, what are you noticing (it does
all the work) It seems to be doing all the work.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:06:00.900
Why does it seem that it is doing all the
work? Ben? (you can't make odd numbers without it) Turn on all your bits again.

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:07.699
What's the difference between the first bit
and all the other bits that you can see?

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:16.439
William? (number 1 is the only odd number) It's the only odd number.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:21.500
We can represent lots of numbers right? I wonder how we would represent letters?

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:31.580
Turn to the person next to you and come up
with any ideas you might have about how to represent letters.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.900
How do you think you might represent a letter?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.920
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, eyes this way.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Hands up whose got a suggestion as to how
we can use these to represent letters. What ideas have you got?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:19.200
(You could have the number represent the letter. 26 could be Z and A could be 1) 26 could be Z, A could be 1, what would B be then? Jacob?

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:27.300
(2), what would C be (3), What would D be? (4), E? (5). I think you've got the hang of it.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:35.600
I wonder if you can work out what I'm sending
you. I'm going to send you a message.

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:44.100
Black, white, black, black, black. What number is that? (8).

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:53.200
What's the eighth letter in the alphabet? (H). Hold that in your head.

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:58.600
Off, on, off, off, on. What number's that? (9)

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:13.500
What have I said to you Zander? (The word that you said to us is "Hi")  Is it? Do you agree with him? Did we do "Hi"?

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:20.900
But these are just dots and cards that are
on and off, can I really communicate a message to you doing that?

00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:38.000
(yes) Let's see how good you are. Let's see if I can communicate what month
I was born in. Are you ready? Off, on, on, off, off.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:44.500
What month was I born in? Whisper it to me, so many people know the answer,
go. (December) You're right.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:52.500
So using binary digits and using these dots
we can communicate anything from a letter to a number.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.500
You can even do images, you can do sound,
you can do movies.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:03.730
Everything involves bits because inside a
computer isn't a whole lot of cards like this,

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:15.000
isn't a whole lot of zeros and ones, but it's
a whole lot of things that need to be turned on or turned off.
