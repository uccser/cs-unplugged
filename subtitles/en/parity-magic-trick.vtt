CS Unplugged
<i>Computer Science without a computer</i>

00:04.600 --> 00:06.200
Parity Magic

00:06.200 --> 00:10.000
Cool so, hands up who thinks
computers are a little bit magical,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.600
they do stuff and we're not too sure how they do it.

00:13.600 --> 00:18.400
Does anyone think they're a little bit magical
or have thought they have been in the past? Cool.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.600
Well I'm going to teach you a magic trick today.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.400
So, what I need is a volunteer
who can make a five by five grid

00:26.400 --> 00:32.800
with these magnetic cards. So it could be white,
or it could be black and it has to be totally random.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.200
Who would like to do that?
Oh thanks Ellie, you come up?

00:36.200 --> 00:39.200
You do that.
Hopefully that's enough cards there, cool.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.000
If you could just make a five by five
grid up here that's great.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Now while she's doing that I want
to explain a little bit

00:45.000 --> 00:51.200
about what's happening. So, I said before
that this is one bit; each of these magnets represents

00:51.200 --> 00:57.800
one bit. A bit can be turned off,
or a bit can be turned on.

00:57.800 --> 01:04.200
Where else have we learned about bits before?
Turn to the person next to you and tell them about that.

NOTE
[silence]

01:18.000 --> 01:20.800
And eyes this way.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.000
So bits, did anyone mention in their whispering,

01:25.000 --> 01:30.600
did anyone mention the words Binary Numbers
when we learned about Binary Numbers the other day?

NOTE changed 'word' to 'words' in the above sentence

01:30.600 --> 01:34.600
Yeah? So these are bits, and these could
be like the Binary Numbers right?

01:34.600 --> 01:37.200
They could be on,
or they could be off.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.000
Cool has she got five by five?

01:40.000 --> 01:45.400
Yeah? Cool thanks Ellie, so I'm going to make
this magic trick just a little bit harder for myself,

01:45.400 --> 01:51.200
and I'm going to put an extra column down here,

01:51.200 --> 01:57.800
and I'm going to put an extra row under here,

01:57.800 --> 02:00.600
just to make it hard.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.000
Okay

02:10.400 --> 02:13.400
Right I've done that, now,

02:13.400 --> 02:19.200
I've got a really bad memory,
and I can't see very well when I take off my glasses.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.600
Ooh, I can't see at all now.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.600
I'm going to ask someone to go up
and turn one of them over,

02:25.600 --> 02:29.200
hands up who thinks I'd be able to guess where it is?

02:29.200 --> 02:31.600
Hands up who thinks that's impossible
if you've got a bad memory,

02:31.600 --> 02:35.200
or is even impossible
if you've got a good memory? Hands up?

02:35.200 --> 02:38.000
Okay, let's see,
Rhylee can you go up and turn one over?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Everyone else you need to check
either that he is turning it over

02:41.000 --> 02:42.800
or you need to check that I'm not cheating,

02:42.800 --> 02:47.000
and I'm not looking.
I'll take my glasses off to be even sure.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.800
Everyone say "done" when he's done it.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.000
["Done"]

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
Right, Hmm, Rhylee Rhylee Rhylee.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.400
Right or wrong?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.600
["Right"]

03:06.600 --> 03:09.000
Was it a fluke, it could have been a fluke right?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.200
Thanks Rhylee let's give him a big hand. Thanks Rhylee.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.800
Okay, who thinks they can trick me,
maybe because it was on the bottom row?

03:15.800 --> 03:18.600
I'd memorised the bottom row? Maybe maybe maybe.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.200
Sammy, I'm going over here this time
so I'm definitely not cheating,

03:22.200 --> 03:26.200
you guys need to watch if Sammy's turned one over
and some of you need to check that I'm not cheating

03:26.200 --> 03:32.000
and I'll even turn off the eyes in the back of my head
just to be sure that's not happening.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.000
["Done"]

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Right let's have a look. Sammy Sammy Sammy.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.000
Right or wrong?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.200
[Confused chorus]

03:50.200 --> 03:52.600
Was I right? Awesome!

03:52.600 --> 03:56.800
So if I get it right two times is it a magic trick?

03:56.800 --> 04:01.000
Or is something else going on?
Hands up if you still think it's still a magic trick?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.200
Hands up if you think there must be something going on.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.000
Cool, let's look at what is going on.

04:10.600 --> 04:16.800
If we had these just as we had them before
and we go through the rows,

04:16.800 --> 04:22.000
how many black cards can you see in this row?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.400
["Four"]

04:23.400 --> 04:25.600
And how many black cards in this one?

04:25.600 --> 04:33.000
["Four"] <04:27.400> ["Four"] <04:29.200> ["Two"]
<04:30.800> ["Four"] <04:32.400> ["Four"]

04:33.000 --> 04:38.200
Okay, now let's look at these columns,
how many are in this column?

NOTE changed 'how many is in' to 'how many are in'

04:38.200 --> 04:48.000
["Two"] <04:40.400> ["Six"] <04:42.200> ["Four"]
<04:43.600> ["Two"] <04:45.000> ["Four"] <04:46.600> ["Four"]

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Hmm, what do those numbers all have in common?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
What are they? How would we classify those numbers?
Yes?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.400
<i>Even Numbers?</i>

04:57.400 --> 05:00.000
Hmm, hands up if you agree with that statement?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
They're even numbers and you are right.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
You are right because I said I was going to make it
harder by adding the extra column and row right?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.800
Did I make it harder or easier?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.000
["Easier"]

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
How did I make it easier when I
added a black card here onto this row?

NOTE Changed 'Why' to 'How'

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
What was I doing?

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
<i>Um, You were making it as, so,
add one more so you could memorise them easily?</i>

05:28.000 --> 05:31.600
Yeah? Well if I didn't do that
how many black cards are there now?

05:31.600 --> 05:32.800
["Three"]

05:32.800 --> 05:36.600
When I add a black card there what am I making it? Taking it from odd to?

05:36.600 --> 05:42.400
["Even"] Even right, so actually
by adding that column and adding that row,

05:42.400 --> 05:50.200
I made all of the black cards even,
so I was able to correct the mistake, correct the error

05:50.200 --> 05:53.400
which is the one that got flipped over.

05:53.400 --> 05:59.200
So let's see how that worked.
I'm going to actually take away the extra column,

05:59.200 --> 06:02.800
and the extra row,
and you're going to tell me what to put.

06:02.800 --> 06:08.600
Now, I am also going to rub out the numbers
so you've got no prompts,<06:07.04> okay?

06:08.600 --> 06:11.000
Are you ready?
I want you to call out black or white

06:11.000 --> 06:13.800
and tell me what I have to do here.
What do I have to do here?

06:13.800 --> 06:18.800
["Black"] <06:15.600> ["Black"]
<06:17.200>[Confused chorus]

06:18.800 --> 06:22.400
<i>Black</i>

06:22.400 --> 06:27.200
["White"] <06:25.200> ["Black"]

06:27.200 --> 06:30.600
Alright, now, all those rows are done, let's do the columns.

06:30.600 --> 06:37.800
["Black"] <06:32.200> ["Black"]
<06:34.400> ["Black"] <06:36.200> ["White"]

06:37.800 --> 06:40.200
Oops, sorry

06:40.200 --> 06:43.600
["Black"] <06:42.200> ["White"]

06:43.600 --> 06:47.200
Okay I want you to see what's happening here,

06:47.200 --> 06:53.400
because if I put it white there:
Does that make that column correct?

06:53.400 --> 06:54.600
["Yes"]

06:54.600 --> 06:58.000
Does it make that row correct?
<06:57.000> ["Yes"]

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
So that corner there, it actually is putting
two of the rows and the columns into place,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.600
so it's quite an important card isn't it?

07:07.600 --> 07:15.600
Okay. So, now that you've seen how it works,
who thinks they would like to have a go at doing this?

07:15.600 --> 07:18.600
Who thinks they'd like to have a go?
Robert, do you think you can do it?

07:18.600 --> 07:21.800
Okay, so you're going to stand over there.
Close your eyes, turn off the eyes

07:21.800 --> 07:24.400
in the back of your head, power them down.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.800
And I need someone who's going
to come up and change it.

07:28.800 --> 07:35.400
Jack, come up and change it for us. Change one,
you guys look and check that he's just changing one,

07:35.400 --> 07:40.600
I'm going to check that
Robert's not going to turn around.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Cool, what are we going to tell Robert?
["Done"]

07:51.000 --> 07:54.200
Okay, Robert come over here
and we're just going to help you with this.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.400
So, this row here, how many are there?

07:57.400 --> 07:59.000
<i>Four</i>
Is that okay? <i>Yes</i>

07:59.000 --> 08:02.200
What about this one? <i>Four</i>
Is that okay? <i>Yes</i>

08:02.200 --> 08:04.800
What about this one? <i>Four</i>
Is that okay? <i>Yes</i>

08:04.800 --> 08:07.400
What about this one? <i>Two</i>
Is that okay? <i>Yes</i>

08:07.400 --> 08:10.400
What about this one?
<08:08.400><i>Three, so there must be a problem.</i>

08:10.400 --> 08:14.600
Ahahahahaa! Let's put a circle around there,

08:14.600 --> 08:18.600
because I think you're right.
I think there is a problem, because it's an odd number.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.400
Do we have to check the next row?
<08:20.600>["No"]

08:21.400 --> 08:24.400
Why not?
<08:22.04><i>Because we're already found the answer.</i>

08:24.400 --> 08:28.800
We've already found the answer and we know
there's only one error to detect right?

08:28.800 --> 08:32.000
So now let's look at the columns:
How many are in here?

NOTE changed 'is' to 'are'

08:32.000 --> 08:32.800
<i>Two</i>

08:32.800 --> 08:34.000
Is that alright?
<i>Yes</i>

08:34.000 --> 08:36.800
What about this one? <i>Six</i>
Is that okay? <i>Yes</i>

08:36.800 --> 08:39.600
What about this one? <i>Four</i>
Is that okay? <i>Yes</i>

08:39.600 --> 08:43.600
What about this one?
<i>One, so there must be detected problem.</i>

08:43.600 --> 08:46.400
There is a problem in there, let's have a look at that.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.400
So, which card was flipped Robert?

08:49.400 --> 08:53.600
<i>This one, because there's a line around there
and a line around there.</i>

08:53.600 --> 08:57.000
<i>So it already gives me
a direct spot to where it is.</i>

08:57.000 --> 08:59.400
Turn it over good work!

08:59.400 --> 09:02.800
Okay hands up if you agree with Robert
that that was the one that was changed?

09:02.800 --> 09:11.400
Cool let's give him a hand well done, cool.
<09:07.600>Thanks Robert.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.200
So, why are we learning this with
a whole lot of magnets on the board

09:15.200 --> 09:17.500
and how does this relate back to the computers?

09:17.500 --> 09:21.200
Because, what we've actually got here
is a representation.

09:21.200 --> 09:28.000
This here that Ellie put up, this is the data
for a piece of music she's written,

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
and she's now uploading that up to the internet.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Now, if she's doing that,
she's probably using phone wires and things,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.600
and so what we're doing is just adding
a little bit more data to her file here,

09:41.600 --> 09:46.300
and her data, and what that's doing,
is if there's any interference;

09:46.300 --> 09:53.400
if for some reason
a signal is off rather than on,

09:53.400 --> 09:59.400
it means that all of this together can be
corrected in the computer and it stays the same

09:59.400 --> 10:02.200
for the person who's receiving it at the other end.

10:02.200 --> 10:07.200
And that's the same with your CDs and DVDs,
so hands up if you've ever had a DVD

10:07.200 --> 10:12.000
where it's starting to glitch,
it's started to get pixelated or the sound's not working?

10:12.000 --> 10:20.600
Right so, hand's down, if you turn your DVD over
you'll see lots and lots of shiny and dull,

10:20.600 --> 10:26.200
things on it? Each of those is a bit, and it holds
billions of bits on your DVD.

10:26.200 --> 10:31.000
And what happens, is if you get a scratch on it,
or if you get one fleck of dust,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.400
if you didn't have this extra data,
your DVD would be of no use,

10:35.400 --> 10:37.000
you'd have to throw it away.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.400
But, the DVD has this extra data on it,
and so if one fleck of dust gets on,

10:43.400 --> 10:45.600
it can cope with that it'll just correct it.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.200
And it has to be quite a decent scratch
before it starts to pixelate.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.600
Have you seen the scratches?
Have you taken the DVD out, looked at it and gone

10:53.600 --> 10:57.000
"Woah, that's really dirty and scratched.
That must be why it's not working."

10:57.000 --> 10:58.400
Have you ever done that?

10:58.400 --> 11:02.600
Cool, and you clean it,
and it works again right hopefully?

11:02.600 --> 11:05.800
And that's because you have gotten it to a state again

11:05.800 --> 11:09.800
that it can now read and it can correct
all the errors and the detections

11:09.800 --> 11:13.600
Cool, thanks.
