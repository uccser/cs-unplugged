"Algorithms are at the heart of Computational Thinking and Computer Science, "
"because in Computer Science the solutions to problems are not simply an "
"answer (e.g. ‘42’, or a fact), they are algorithms. An algorithm is a step-"
"by-step process that solves a problem or completes a task. If you follow the "
"algorithm's steps correctly, you will arrive at a correct solution, even for "
"different inputs. For example, we can use an algorithm to find the shortest "
"route between two locations on a map; the same algorithm can be used for any "
"pair of starting and finishing points, so the solution depends on the input "
"to the algorithm. If we know the algorithm for solving a problem then we can "
"solve that problem easily, whenever we want, without having to think! We can "
"just follow the steps. Computers can’t think for themselves, so they need to "

msgid ""
"Abstraction is all about simplifying things to help us manage complexity. It "
"requires identifying what the most important aspects of a problem are and "
"hiding the other specific details that we don’t need to focus on. The "
"important aspects can be used to create a model, or simplified "
"representation, of the original thing we were dealing with. We can then work "

"the nitty gritty details at once. Computer Scientists often work with "
"multiple levels of abstraction."
msgstr ""

#: templates/general/computational-thinking.html:176

"We use abstraction often in our everyday lives, for example when we use "

"roads and street names."
msgstr ""

"Digital devices use abstraction all the time; they try to hide as much "
"unnecessary information from the user as possible. For example, let's say "
"you took a nice scenic photo on your last camping trip, and now you want to "
"edit it on your laptop and adjust the colours in it. Normally we could do "
"this by opening a picture editing program, adjusting some colour sliders or "

"The picture you took is stored on the computer as a big list of pixels, "

"lot of information. Imagine if when you adjusted the colours you had to go "
"through and look at all the colour values of every pixel and change each and "
"every one of those! That’s what the computer is doing for you, but since you "

"Decomposition is about breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable, "

"Generalising is also referred to as 'pattern recognition and "
"generalisation'. Generalisation is taking a solution (or part of a solution) "
"to a problem and generalising it so it can be applied to other similar "

"means we take an algorithm and make it general enough that it can be used "

"Evaluation is about identifying the possible solutions to a problem and "

"There are different ways we can evaluate our algorithmic solutions. We can "
"test their speed by implementing them on a computer; or we can analyse them "

"test that they work correctly by giving our solution lots of different "
"inputs, and checking it works as expected. When we do this we need to think "
"about the different inputs we test, because we don’t want to check every "
"possible input (often there's an infinite number of different possible "
"inputs!), but we still need to know if it will work for them. Testing is "
"something Computer Scientists and programmers do all the time. But because "
