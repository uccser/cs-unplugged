Most of the time this 'agent' means a computer or other type of digital device - but it could also be a human! We’ll refer to it as a computer to make things a bit simpler. To represent solutions in a way that a computer can carry them out, we have to represent them as a step by step process - an <strong>algorithm</strong>. To create these algorithmic solutions we apply some special problem solving skills to. These skill are what make up Computational Thinking! And they are skills that are transferrable to any field."

An algorithm is a step-by-step process that solves a problem or completes a task. If you follow the algorithm's steps correctly, you will arrive at a correct solution, even for different inputs. For example, we can use an algorithm to find the shortest route between two locations on a map; the same algorithm can be used for any pair of starting and finishing points, so the solution depends on the input to the algorithm. If we know the algorithm for solving a problem then we can solve that problem easily, whenever we want, without having to think! We can just follow the steps. Computers can’t think for themselves, so they need to be given algorithms to do things."

It requires identifying what the most important aspects of a problem are and hiding the other specific details that we don’t need to focus on. The important aspects can be used to create a model, or simplified representation, of the original thing we were dealing with. We can then work with this model to solve the problem, rather than having to deal with all the nitty gritty details at once. Computer Scientists often work with multiple levels of abstraction."

For example, let's say you took a nice scenic photo on your last camping trip, and now you want to edit it on your laptop and adjust the colours in it. Normally we could do this by opening a picture editing program, adjusting some colour sliders or maybe choosing a filter.

Since solutions in Computer Science are algorithms, this means we take an algorithm and make it general enough that it can be used for a range of problems.

Evaluation is something we do a lot in our everyday lives."

We can test their speed by implementing them on a computer; or we can analyse them by counting or calculating how many steps they are likely to take. We can test that our algorithmic solutions work correctly by giving them lots of different inputs, and checking they work as expected. When we do this we need to think about the different inputs we test, because we don’t want to check every possible input (often there's an infinite number of possible inputs!), but we still need to know if our algorithmic solutions will work for all inputs. Testing is something Computer Scientists and programmers do all the time. But because we can't usually test every possible input, we also try to evaluate a system using logical reasoning."

For example, the parity magic trick is a card game that happens to use the same principle as error correction in computer memory.

msgid "The activities tend to be kinaesthetic, often on a large scale and involving team work. For example, the Sorting Network activity has teams of six running through a network drawn on the ground. The activities tend to allow students to discover answers for themselves, rather than just being given solutions or algorithms to follow; that is, a constructivist approach is encouraged (where the teacher uses the scaffolding provided by Unplugged to ask questions that lead them to discover the knowledge themselves), as we want students to realize that they are capable of finding solutions to problems on their own, rather than being given a solution to apply to the problem. For example, students don’t really need to be able to convert numbers to binary, but it is valuable for them to discover the patterns such as the doubling value of bits, patterns when you count in binary, and how the range increases exponentially as you add bits."

msgid "The activities are fun and engaging, not just busy-work for the sake of it. Usually the explanations are quite brief – the teacher lays out the materials and a few rules, and the students follow the challenge from there. There are puzzles, challenges, competitions, problem solving and humour. Unplugged activities should leave students with a sense of genuine achievement. There is often a strong sense of story in the activities; problems are presented as part of a story rather than as an abstract mathematical challenge. Children are more interested in pirates than privacy, and absurd fictitious stories can be more memorable than compelling business applications."

msgid "The CS Unplugged activities are intended to give you a feel for what the subject is - you can learn what it is by doing. At this early stage, rather than define it formally, let's think about how it might influence our daily lives. For example, think of your favourite search engine. On the surface it seems like a fairly simple interface: a text box where you type what you want to search for, and a button to start the search. The level of programming knowledge needed to implement a text box and a button is fairly rudimentary, and you could implement a search by writing a short program (probably less than 20 lines) to go through all the text on the web and displaying any that match. But obviously there's more to it than this! There are billions of searches are made every day, on billions on web pages, and the approach above will give answers (eventually), but will be so slow and ineffective that no-one would use it."

How could you search billions of items in a fraction of a second (Searching Algorithms)? How do you make sure that it's easy to use (Human-Computer Interaction)? We need to keep it secure - users don't want other people to know what they are searching for, and the search engine doesn't want commercial interests to manipulate search ranking (Computer Security and Encryption)? Search engines generally predict what you are about to search for (Artificial Intelligence). It needs to be reliable - a small mistake from one of the thousands of programmers at a search engine company shouldn't prevent the site working (Software Engineering). It needs to scale well - if it becomes 10 times as popular, you don't want it to need 100 times the computing resources (Algorithms). The relevance of a search generally depends on the relationships between web sites - you need a map showing which sites are linked to which other ones (Graphs)."

We don't want them to see digital systems as some kind of magic that they can't participate in, but as something that they could understand and, for some, create themselves. Actually, it is kind of magic when you start understanding what can and can't be done."
