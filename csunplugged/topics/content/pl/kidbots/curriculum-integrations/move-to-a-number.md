# Move to a number

Using the same structure and resources as the [Rescue Mission]('topics:lesson' 'kidbots' 'unit-plan' 'rescue-mission') lesson, we can integrate numeracy with Kidbots.

## Lesson activity

Fill a Kidbots grid with any combination of the following, according to the level the students are able to work with:

- Numbers on pieces of paper.
- Ladybugs with different numbers of dots.
- Counters of various numbers.

Possible goals for students to move the bot to could include:

- Move to the square with 5 counters.
- Move to the ladybug with an even number of dots.
- Move to the answer of 8 + 5.

### The next challenge

Program the object to make 6 by having him move first to the number 3 and then to the ladybird with 3 dots.

## Lesson reflection

Who are the students who can visualise what needs to be programmed?
