# Calculate the exponents of numbers

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter 2 numbers (an integer for the base and a positive integer for the power) and calculates the results of the first number to the power of the second number. You can assume that the power is 0 or more.

Note: The exponent of a number says how many times to use that number in a multiplication. (e.g. 83 = 8 × 8 × 8 = 512 so the exponent 3 says to use the 8 three times in a multiplication.)

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided;

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3<br>5</td>
    <td>3^5 = 243</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-2<br>4</td>
    <td>-2^4 = 16</td>
  </tr>
</table>
