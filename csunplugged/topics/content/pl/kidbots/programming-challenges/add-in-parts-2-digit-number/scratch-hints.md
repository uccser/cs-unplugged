- Make two variables called “num1” and “num2” and set their values to the inputs entered by the user.
- To make “num1” a tidy number, split “num2” into 2 parts (call these variables “add to tidy num1” and “left from num2”) so the sum of one part and “num1” is a multiple of 10.
- To calculate the value of the variable “add to tidy num1”, subtract the last digit of “num1” from 10 (i.e. 10 - “num1” modulo 10). For example to make 74 a tidy number, you need to add 6 (10-(74 modulo 10)) making it a tidy number 80.
