# Draw different types of triangles

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter an angle between 0 and 180 (not including 0 and 180), draws a triangle with two equal sides of length 100 steps (an isosceles triangle), starting from x:0, y:0, with the given angle between them. It then displays a message saying if the triangle drawn is an acute, right or an obtuse triangle.

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided:

| Input | Output                      |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| 45    | This is an acute triangle.  |
| 90    | This is a right triangle.   |
| 120   | This is an obtuse triangle. |
