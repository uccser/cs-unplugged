- The custom block `scratch:move_forward() :: custom` moves the “cat” sprite forward for the number of tiles entered as its input (i.e. move_forward(3) would move the “cat” sprite 3 tiles forward). The distance from the centre of one tile to a neighbouring tile is 50 steps long, so for this reason we have used a variable called “one tile” which is always set to 50.
- The custom block `scratch:turn_right :: custom` rotates the “cat” sprite to the right 90 degrees.
- The custom block `scratch:turn_left :: custom` rotates the “cat” sprite to the left 90 degrees.
- When your set of instructions are complete, press the “Go” button. If your instructions were incorrect (i.e. the cat didn’t catch the mouse), press the “Restart” button and start over.
- The “cat” sprite can not go through the blue tiles. If your instructions takes the “cat” over any of the blue tiles, you will hear a crash sound with a message instructing you to press the “restart” button and start again.
- To change to a new background press the "Change background" button. Every time the "Change background" button is pressed, the program stamps blue tiles in 15 random locations inside the grid.
