- You can find the number digits in a number by using the `scratch:length of ()` block unders “Operators”. For example: `scratch:length of (293833992383) //12`

- You can access a letter (or a digit) at a specified position in a string (or number) by using the `scratch:letter () of []` block under “Operators”. For example: `scratch:letter (4) of [18392819202910] //9`

- In this challenge you need to access all the digits of the product code number entered, adding the 1st, 3rd, 5th and so on digits and storing the result in variable "total 1" and adding the 2nd, 4th, 6th and so on digits and storing the result in variable "total 2". The output displays if the sum of "total 1" multiplied by 3 and "total 2" is a multiple of 10 or not.
