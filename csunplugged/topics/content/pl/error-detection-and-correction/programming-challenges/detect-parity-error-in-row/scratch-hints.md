- You can access a letter at the specified position in a string by using the `scratch:letter (1) of [world]` block under “Operators”. For example: `scratch:letter (1) of [world] //w`

- In this challenge you need to access all the letters in user’s input and check to see how many of them are equal to B (black). Store the total number of black squares in a variable called “black cards total”.

- You can find how many letters a string has by using the `scratch:length of [world]` block unders “Operators”.

- To find out if a number is even or odd, use the `scratch:() mod ()` block (under "Operators") to find the remainder after dividing that number by two. If the remainder is zero the number is even. For example: `scratch:(37) mod (10) //7`
