- For the first 15 digits of the credit card, multiply every odd digit by 2 (i.e. 1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on digits), but if this gives a 2-digit number you should subtract 9 from it. For example, if the input digit 8 is multiplied by 2, that gives 16, and subtracting 9 from that gives 7 to add to the running total (some descriptions of the method say that you should add the two digits together, which gives the same result e.g. for 8x2 = 16 adding the digits in the result is 1+6, which is also 7).

- You then add the sum of these values to the sum of the even digits. The last digit (check digit) is calculated by subtracting the final total from 0 mod 10.
