# Error detection and correction

The world is a complicated and imperfect place, and errors can occur when digital information is stored or transmitted. Data stored on digital devices can be changed if there is a tiny fault in the hardware (and these occur regularly); and data being transmitted over networks can be messed up if there's a problem with the connection (which is bound to happen at some stage). This unit and lessons explores how digital devices detect and correct errors in data, and why sometimes computers can detect errors, but donâ€™t have enough information to correct them.
