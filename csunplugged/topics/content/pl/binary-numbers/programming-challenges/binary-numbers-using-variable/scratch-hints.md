- Make a variable called “number of dots” and change its value by setting it to 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 respectively. You can find “make a new variable” under the “data” script to create a new variable. Make sure your variable name is meaningful for someone else to read. In the above example, the variable is called "number of dots" because it stores the number of dots on a card.
- Use the `scratch:set [number of dots v] to [0]` block to set the value of your new variable.
- Display the value of your variable on the screen by replacing “Hello” in your `scratch:say [Hello] for (2) secs` block with your variable.
- The number of seconds tells the output how long to show. The script waits that long before continuing.
- Make sure all your blocks are “snapped” together in a line like a jigsaw puzzle.
- Whenever you click the green flag, your script will start. To stop, click the stop button.
