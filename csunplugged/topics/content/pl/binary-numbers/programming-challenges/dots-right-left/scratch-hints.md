- Make variables:
    
    - “number of cards” to store the number of cards to display entered by the end user as the input (e.g. 4).
    - “number of dots” to store the number of dots.
    - “binary cards” which is a variable type string and stores what is going to be displayed on the screen as the output (e.g. “1, 2, 4, 8,”).

- Use the `scratch: (join [hello] [world])` block under “Operators” to combine two strings. You can use multiple join blocks inside each other if you need to combine more than two strings.

- In Scratch, to concatenate data together you use the `scratch: (join [hello] [world])` blocks. This can be used to join text, variables and calculations. Remember to check if the spaces are correct between the items being joined!
