- Make a variable called “total number of dots” and set it to 0. Add the corresponding number of dots (16 for the first input, 8 for the second input and so on) to the “total number of dots” every time the end user enters ‘W’ as the input. You would need to use 5 `scratch:if <> then` blocks for this challenge.
- Use the `scratch:set [] to [0]` block to set the value of your new variable. Use the `scratch:() + ()` operation under “Operators” to add to the value of your variable.
- The `scratch:if <> then` block checks if the condition is true and then runs the blocks inside of the if block.
