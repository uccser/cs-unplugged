- Make a variable called “number of cards” to store the number of cards to display entered by the end user as the input (e.g. 5) and a variable called “number of dots” to store the number of dots (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) where each number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.

- In this challenge, use the `scratch:ask [What's your name?] and wait` block to receive an input from the user. Replace the text “What’s your name?” with your own question. The user input will be stored in a predefined variable called “answer” after the check mark button is clicked or the “Enter” key is pressed. You can view the value of “answer” by clicking the checkbox next to the answer block. Set the value of variable “number of cards” to “answer”. Use a repeat loop, repeating the blocks inside (displaying the number of dots) “number of cards” times.
