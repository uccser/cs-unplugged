- Make a variable called “number of dots” and set it to the largest number of dots entered as the input. Divide the value of “number of dots” by 2 and display the result as the output until “number of dots” is equal to 1.
- Use the `scratch:() / ()` operation under “Operators” to divide the value of your variable by 2.
- Use the `scratch:repeat until <>` block to run the blocks inside while the condition is true. In this challenge you need to repeat the blocks until number of dots is equal to 1.
