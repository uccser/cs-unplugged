# Display the number of bits needed to represent a number

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of dots (i.e. decimal value) as the input and displays how many bits will be needed to represent that number as the output. For example, the number 15 can be represented in 4 bits, but 16 requires 5 bits. You can work this out by starting with the number 1, and doubling it until it gives you a value more than the number you need to represent, so this program can be based on the earlier challenge to work out the number of dots on each card.
