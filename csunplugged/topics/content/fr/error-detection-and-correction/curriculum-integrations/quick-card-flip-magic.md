*Every item of data that we store and transmit has extra bits added to it to prevent errors. Can you find the error and correct it?*

### Equipment:

At least 36, or even 100 or more cards that are black on one side and white on the other, about 20mm by 20mm (or any two colours that are easily distinguished) A clear space on the floor or a table that the students can stand around

### Preparation:

Select a ‘magic master’. This is the person who is in control of the game. This person will change at the end of each round.

### Instructions:

1. The magic master sets up the cards on the floor, including parity cards in the last row and column, using someone from the group as their assistant. The grid can be any size; it should be at least 6 by 6, although it can be increased up to 10 by 10 or more to make the challenge harder. La grille ne doit pas nécessairement être carrée (par exemple 9 par 8 fonctionne), mais l'effet est meilleur quand la grille est proche d'un carré.

2. The magic master asks everyone to close their eyes and turn away, except for the magic master and the assistant.

3. Le magicien demande à l'assistant de choisir une carte, place un compteur ou une marque sous l'emplacement de la carte et la retourne.

4. Once this has been done, the magic master calls out (quietly)…” let the magic begin” and presses the timer. When the other students hear this they turn around and try to find the ‘error’.

5. As soon as they spot the error, they put their finger on their nose.

6. Le magicien arrête le chronomètre et demande à la première personne qui à mis le doigt sur son nez de montrer où se trouve la carte qui a été retournée.

7. The student points to the flipped card, checks if they are correct by flipping the card over.

8. If they are correct, that person explains how they worked out which was the flipped card.

9. The magic master records the person's name who won that round and the time.

10. Did they beat the previous time?

11. If they did beat the previous time, that person becomes the assistant. The person who won that round stays the assistant until their time is beaten.
