# Finding shapes

Using the same structure and resources as the [Rescue Mission]('topics:lesson' 'kidbots' 'unit-plan' 'rescue-mission') lesson, we can integrate geometry with Kidbots.

## Activités de la leçon

Fill a Kidbots grid with 2D or 3D shapes, according to the level the students are able to work with.

Students should then try to move the bot object to a shape of the teacher's choosing, for example, "We’re going to write our own program that gets the plane to find a triangle."

## The next challenge:

Add barriers to the grid so that the path is more complex because it needs to avoid the barriers. This could be blocks blocking the way.

Who are the students who can visualise what needs to be programmed?
