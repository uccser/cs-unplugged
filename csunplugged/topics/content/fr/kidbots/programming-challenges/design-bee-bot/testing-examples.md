# Design a Bee-Bot

## Exemples de tests :

You will need to test your program by typing in your own commands to the simulated Bee-Bot to see if it behaves as intended. So you're testing your Scratch program by writing programs for the Bee-Bot!

To use the program, when the green flag is clicked, give instructions to the cat to catch the mouse by pressing the arrows for the Bee-Bot. Press the “Go” button when you are ready.
