## Sample story line

The Best Cow in the Land competition results are in and the top 31 cows entered are listed in order from the heaviest to the lightest. Ces vaches ont été ramenées dans leurs fermes à travers le pays.

Now no-one knew that hiding in the hills was a very hungry giant, who loved roast beef the best, and tended to roast a whole cow at a time. This giant had a fantastic memory and had memorised, not only the order of the cows from heaviest to lightest, but also which farm they were on and where the farms are. The giant starts at the farm with the heaviest cow, and gradually works down in the order of their weights.

A giant slayer is called in to find the hungry giant. The giant slayer can tell if the giant has been at a farm because the cow will be missing - if the cow is still at a farm then the giant must be at a farm with heavier cows, but if the cow is gone, then the giant must be at the farms with lighter cows.

## Votre tâche

To make up a stop motion video or play that demonstrates that the giant is using a sequential search to eat the cows in order from heaviest to smallest and that the giant slayers who need to stop the giant from eating all the cows can easily find the giant before too many cows are eaten by using a binary search.

### Supplément pour les experts

You could change the setting and characters but keep the theme of the story!

Remember that a searching algorithm follows the same rules every time to find an answer.
