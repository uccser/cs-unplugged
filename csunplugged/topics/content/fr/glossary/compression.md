# Compression

Compression is the process of trying to make something smaller. On computers, data compression is about using a compression algorithm to reduce the size of files, so that they take up less space and can be transmitted faster. This is generally done by trying to find repeated or predictable patterns in a file and replacing them with short codes that convey they same information.
