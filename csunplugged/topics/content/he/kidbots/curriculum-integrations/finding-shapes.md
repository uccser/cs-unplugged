# Finding shapes

Using the same structure and resources as the [Rescue Mission]('topics:lesson' 'kidbots' 'unit-plan' 'rescue-mission') lesson, we can integrate geometry with Kidbots.

## Lesson activities

Fill a Kidbots grid with 2D or 3D shapes, according to the level the students are able to work with.

Students should then try to move the bot object to a shape of the teacher's choosing, for example, "Weâ€™re going to write our own program that gets the plane to find a triangle."

## The next challenge:

Add barriers to the grid so that the path is more complex because it needs to avoid the barriers. This could be blocks blocking the way.

## Lesson reflection

Who are the students who can visualise what needs to be programmed?
