- To translate a shape, every point of the shape must move the same distance in the same direction.
- To draw the above image, translate the cube by the distance of the squareâ€™s diagonal, which is approximately 1.412 times the length of a side i.e. 70.71 if the side was 50 steps. (This is calculated using Pythagoras' theorem: \( d = \sqrt{side^{2} + side^{2}} = side \sqrt{2} \))
