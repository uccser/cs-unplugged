Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided;

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11<br>12</td>
    <td>The new time is 23:00.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>22<br>2</td>
    <td>The new time is: 00:00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>22<br>4</td>
    <td>The new time is: 02:00</td>
