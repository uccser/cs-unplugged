- The radius of a circle is the distance of its centre to the edge of the circle.
- The circumference is the distance around a circle (its perimeter) and is equal to \(2 \pi r\) where \(r\) is the radius of the circle. 
- To be able to draw the circle right in the centre, you will need to set your sprite to point in the right direction. To set the direction of the current sprite use the `scratch:point in direction (0 v)` block under the “motion” script.
