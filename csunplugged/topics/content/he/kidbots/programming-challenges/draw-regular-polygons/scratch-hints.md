- A regular polygon has all angles equal and all sides equal.
- The turning angle or external angle for a regular polygon can be calculated by dividing 360 by the number of sides of the polygon. Note that the turning angle at each vertex of the polygon is different from the inside or the interior angle (i.e. the turning angle and the inside angle of each vertex of the polygon add up to 180 degrees).
- Block `scratch:wait () secs` waits specified number of seconds, then continues with next block. To be able to see each sides of the polygon being drawn, use the **wait** block after turning each angle.
