- You need to add up 1st, 3rd, 5th and so on digits and store the result in a variable called "total 1". Then add up 2nd, 4th, 6th and so on digits and store the result in variable called "total 2". The last digit (check digit) is then calculated by subtracting the sum of "total 2" multiplied by 3, and "total 1" from 0 mod 10.
