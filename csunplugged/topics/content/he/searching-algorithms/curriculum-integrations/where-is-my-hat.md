What is something that you or your class lose all the time? In this example the student has lost their school hat.

Make a list of all the places they could look for it. This student might look on the playground, in the lost property box, in the area where they keeps their things; like their desk, locker, or in their bag. Write a sequential search algorithm for searching each place and finding your hat! Test that it works!
