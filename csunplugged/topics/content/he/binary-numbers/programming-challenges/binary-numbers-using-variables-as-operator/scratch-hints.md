- Make a variable called “number of dots” and change its value by using an operator (multiplying it by 2 before displaying it on the screen each time). You can find “make a new variable” under “data” script to create a new variable. Make sure your variable name is as descriptive as possible.
- Use the `scratch:set [number of dots v] to [1]` block to set the value of your new variable. Use the `scratch:() * ()` operation under “Operators” to double the value of your variable.
- Display the value of your variable on the screen by replacing “Hello” in your `scratch:say [Hello] for (2) secs` block with your new variable.
