- Make a variable called `number_of_dots` and set its value to 1.
- To multiply a number in Python, use the `*` symbol. For example: `2 * 3` is equal to `6`.
- To double a variable's value, set the variable to be itself multiplied by 2. For example: If you have the variable `age` and it is set to `5`, you can double the variable with `age = age * 2`.
- The `print()` statement allows you to display text or values within the parentheses on the screen. For example: `print(100)` would display `100` on the screen.
