# Convert a decimal number to a binary number (alternative method)

## Requirement:

Using a different method from “Binary challenge 7.3”, write a program that asks the user to enter any decimal number as the input and displays the binary cards representing that number using '1' for dots showing and '0' for not showing as the output (this converts the decimal number to binary). This method generates the number from right to left by observing that an even number has a 0 on the right, and an odd number as a 1 on the right.

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided:

| Input | Output                                                |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 31    | The binary representation for the number 31 is 11111  |
| 32    | The binary representation for the number 32 is 100000 |
