- Make variables called:
    
    - “number of dots” to store the number of dots 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 where each number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.
    - “binary cards” to store a set of strings “1, 2, 4, 8, 16,” and displays it as the output.

- Use the `scratch:(join [hello] [world])` block under “Operators” to combine two strings. You can use multiple join blocks inside each other if you need to combine more than two strings.

- In Scratch, to concatenate data together you use the `scratch:(join [hello] [world])` blocks. This can be used to join text, variables and calculations. Remember to check if the spaces are correct between the items being joined!
- Use the `scratch:repeat()` block to run the blocks inside a specified number of times. In this challenge you need to repeat the blocks 5 times (4 times for the extra challenge).
