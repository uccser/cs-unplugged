# Binary numbers

Computers today use digits to represent information - that's why they're called digital systems. The simplest and most common way to represent digits is the binary number system, with just two digits (usually written as 0 and 1). It is called binary because there are only two different digits used, or two states. This unit and lesson explores how the binary system works and why itâ€™s important to understand how data is represented.
