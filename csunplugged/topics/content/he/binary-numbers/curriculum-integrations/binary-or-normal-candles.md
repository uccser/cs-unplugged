# Binary Candles or Normal Candles on your Cake

On a birthday cake we often use one candle for each year of age.

But since each candle can be either lit or not lit, we could use them to show a binary representation of your age. For example, 14 years old is 1110 in binary, so you could represent it with four candles.

(By the way, the traditional system is called unary, or base one. Each candle is worth one times as much as the previous one!)
