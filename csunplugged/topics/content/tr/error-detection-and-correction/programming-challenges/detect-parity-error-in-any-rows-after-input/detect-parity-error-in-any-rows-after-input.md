# Detect parity error in any number of rows (after all the rows are entered)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user how many rows they would like to enter then asks for the rows one row at a time. It then displays the rows with parity error at the end as the output. You will need to use a list to store all the rows for this challenge (store each row as an item of the list).
