# Add in parts (add two 1-digit numbers)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers less than 10 (entering the larger number first). If the numbers add up to 10 or less you can just display the two numbers, but if they add up to more than 10, then by splitting numbers into parts, the program should display how they can be added together by making a sum up to 10 (e.g. if the numbers entered are 6 and 5 it displays 6+5 as (6+4)+1). It then displays the answer which is 11.
