- Make two variables called `num1` and `num2` and set their values to the inputs entered by the user.
- To make `num1` a tidy number, split `num2` into 2 parts (call these variables `add_to_tidy_num1` and `left_from_num2`) so the sum of one part and `num1` is a multiple of 10.
- To calculate the value of the variable `add_to_tidy_num1`, subtract the last digit of `num1` from 10 (i.e. `10 - num1 % 10`). For example to make 74 a tidy number, you need to add 6 (10-(74 modulo 10)) making it a tidy number 80.
