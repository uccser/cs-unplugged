# Binary numbers

Computers today use digits to represent information - that's why they're called digital systems. The simplest and most common way to represent digits is the binary number system, with just two digits (usually written as 0 and 1). It is called binary because there are only two different digits used, or two states. This unit and lessons explore how the binary system works and why it’s important to understand how data is represented.
