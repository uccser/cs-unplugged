# Binary Candles or Normal Candles on your Cake

On a birthday cake we often use one candle for each year of age.

But since each candle can be either lit or not lit, we could use them to show a binary representation of your age. For example, 14 years old is 1110 in binary, so you could represent it with four candles.

Persuade people to start using binary candles on their birthday cake.

- What are the advantages of using binary candles?
- Why do binary candles get better when you get older?
- Are there any disadvantages of using binary candles and how would you overcome them?

(By the way, the traditional system is called unary, or base one. Each candle is worth one times as much as the previous one!)
