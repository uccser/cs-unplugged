# Searching algorithms

Searching for a keyword, a value, or a specific piece of data (information) is the basis of many computing applications, whether itâ€™s looking up a bank account balance, using an internet search engine, or searching for a file on your laptop. Computers deal with a lot of information so we need efficient algorithms for searching. The first unit explores sequential and binary searching algorithms, which enable them to become familiar with the factors involved in choosing between different algorithms for the same purpose. Once students understand these searching algorithms, there is a unit on data structures for searching, which open up even more options. All of these searching algorithms are used in practice to search for data on computers. There is also the opportunity to integrate this learning within statistics unit.
