# Display binary numbers (in one line of output)

## Requirement:

Write a program to display numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 on the screen, all in one line of output. You need to use two variables, one for storing the number of dots (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16) and one to store a the line of output (i.e. “1, 2, 4, 8, 16”).

## Testing examples:

The output will always show the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 in one line (there is no input).
