- Make a variable called `number_of_dots` and change its value by setting it to 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 respectively. Make sure your variable name is meaningful for someone else to read. In the above example, the variable is called `number_of_dots` because it stores the number of dots on a card.
- Use `number_of_dots = 0` to set the value of your new variable. This code would set `number_of_dots` to zero.
- The `print()` statement allows you to display text or values within the parentheses on the screen. For example: `print(100)` would display `100` on the screen.
- You will need to use a `print()` statement for each number you wish to display.
