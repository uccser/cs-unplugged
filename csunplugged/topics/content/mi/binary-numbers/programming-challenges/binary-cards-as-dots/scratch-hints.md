We have provided 4 different solutions to code this program, based on two template programs.

The first three sample solutions are based on [remixing this program](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/159437081/). Remix this program and change its name to: Binary challenge 9 (version 1).

For this version, all cards should change to black when the green flag is pressed, and then a program can work through each of the bit values and broadcast to a card if it should change costume.

The fourth variation is based on remixing [this program](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/159499667/). Remix this program and change its name to: Binary challenge 9 (version 2).

This solution displays 5 cards (with dots showing for all the cards) on the screen and asks the user to enter a number between 0 and 31. It then clones a black card sprite over the cards which need to be hidden (dots not showing).

The fourth variation should work like this:
