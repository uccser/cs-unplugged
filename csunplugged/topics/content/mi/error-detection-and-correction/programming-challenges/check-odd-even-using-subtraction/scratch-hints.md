- To check if a number is greater, less than or equal to another number use the `scratch:<[] < []>`, `scratch:<[] > []>`, or `scratch:<[] = []>` blocks under “Operators”.
- You can make a negative number positive by multiplying it by -1.
- The `scratch:< <> or <> >` operation under “Operators” joins two boolean blocks so any one of them can be true to return *true*. If at least one of them is true, the block returns *true*. If neither of them are true, it returns *false*.
