# Check for odd/even numbers using repeated subtraction

## Requirement:

Create a program which asks the user to enter a number and checks if the number is odd or even. You should do this by keep subtracting 2 from your number until it is 0 or 1 (i.e. If it is 0 then the number is even and if it is 1 the number is odd). Make sure your program works for negative numbers as well.

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided:

| Input | Output                      |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| 265   | You entered an odd number!  |
|       | You entered an even number! |
| -22   | You entered an even number! |
