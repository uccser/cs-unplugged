- Make a variable called “black cards total” and set its value to 0. Make a string variable called “cards” and set its value to the input entered by the end user. Check each letter of the string and if it’s ‘B’ add 1 to the “black cards total”. Display the “black cards total” as the output.

- You can access a letter at the specified position in a string by using the `scratch:letter (1) of [world]` block under “Operators”. For example: `scratch:letter (1) of [world] //w`

- In this challenge you need to access all the letters in user’s input and check to see if each of them is equal to B (black).

- You can find how many letters a string has by using the `scratch:length of [world]` block unders “Operators”.
