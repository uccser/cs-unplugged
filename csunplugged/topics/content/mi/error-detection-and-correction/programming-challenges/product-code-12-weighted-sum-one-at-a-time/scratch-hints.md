- You need to add up 1st, 3rd, 5th and so on digits and store the result in a variable called total 1. Then add up 2nd, 4th, 6th and so on digits and store the result in variable called total 2. Store the sum of total 1 multiplied by 3 and total 2 in a variable called total. The output displays if this total is a multiple of 10 or not (i.e. if “total” mod 10 is equal to 0).
