# Sorting networks

As consumers we expect computers to process information as quickly as possible so that programs run faster, websites load faster, and we donâ€™t have to spend a long time watching progress bars and the spinning wheel that appears when computers are thinking about something! One way to increase the speed of a computer is to write programs that use fewer computational steps (as shown in the lessons on sorting and searching algorithms). Another way to solve problems faster is to have several computers work on different parts of the same task at the same time, which is what this unit explores.
