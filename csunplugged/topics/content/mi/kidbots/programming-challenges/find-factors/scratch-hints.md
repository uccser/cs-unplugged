We have provided 2 different algorithms to code this program;

Algorithms to find the factors of “number”:

Solution 1:

1. Create a variable called “divisor” and set its value to 1.
2. If “number” mod “divisor” is 0, “divisor” is one of the factors.
3. Increase the value of “divisor” by 1.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until “divisor” > “number”.

Solution 2:

1. Create a variable called “divisor” and set its value to the “number”.
2. If “number” mod “divisor” is 0, “divisor” is one of the factors.
3. Decrease the value of “divisor” by 1.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until “divisor” = 0.
