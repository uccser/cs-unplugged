Edit your program so it can take any integer (including negative integers) for the power (e.g. \(8^{-2} = \frac{1}{8^{2}} = \frac{1}{64}\)).

Note: To make a negative number positive you can take its absolute value. For example the absolute value of -9 is +9 and the absolute value of +9 is +9. That is `scratch:[abs v] of (-9) // 9`. To return an absolute value of a number in Scratch, choose the “abs” function from the drop down menu of `scratch:[sqrt v] of ()` block under the “operators” scripts.
