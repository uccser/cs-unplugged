- To find out if a number is even or odd, use the “mod” operation to find the remainder after dividing that number by two. If the remainder is zero the number is even (the `scratch:() mod ()` operation under “Operators” script returns the remainder from division of two numbers. For example: `scratch:(17) mod (3) // 2`)
