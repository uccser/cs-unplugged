- Make a list called “notes” and add the 12 notes; C, C#, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, Bb and B to your list (list of length 12).
- When you apply the mod 12 function to the midi value you'll get a number ranging from 0 to 11, but in Scratch the first item in the list “notes” (which is C) is stored at index 1. To display the correct corresponding note, you'll need to add 1 to the value of the midi value mod 12.
