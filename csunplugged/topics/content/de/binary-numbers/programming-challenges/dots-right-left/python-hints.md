- Make variables:
    
    - `number_of_cards` to store the number of cards to display entered by the end user as the input (e.g. 4).
    - `number_of_dots` to store the number of dots.
    - `binary_cards` which is a variable type string and stores what is going to be displayed on the screen as the output (e.g. "1, 2, 4, 8,").

- Use the addition operator to combine strings. You can use multiple to combine multiple strings. Remember to check if the spaces are correct between the items being joined!

- Use the `input()` function to get the user's input. You can place text inside the brackets of input if you'd like to display your question.
