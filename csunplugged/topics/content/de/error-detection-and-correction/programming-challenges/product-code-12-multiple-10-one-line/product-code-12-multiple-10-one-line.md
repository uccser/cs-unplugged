# 12 digit product codes: Check if total is a multiple of 10 (one line of input)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter a 12 digit product code, all in
one line of input.
Then adds up all the digits, every second one multiplied by 3 (1st, 3rd,
and so on) and show if this total is a multiple of 10 (valid product code).
For this challenge make sure the user can only enter a 12 digit product code.

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given
inputs provided:

| Input        | Output                |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| 838310022524 | Valid product code!   |
| 811571013579 | Valid product code!   |
| 838310032524 | Invalid product code! |
| 614141000012 | Valid product code!   |
| 811571023579 | Invalid product code! |
| 664141000012 | Invalid product code! |
