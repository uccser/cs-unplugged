# Design a Bee-Bot

## Requirement:

{panel type="general"}

# Note

This is a very complex program, but if students can understand it then they will have tackled a deep concept in computer science, which is implementing a programming language using another programming language! For students with less programming experience, it may be more helpful to start with the complete project and make modifications to it, such as adding a new command (like "spin", which spins the cat on the spot). See **KidBots challenges 1.2 and 1.3** for the complete solutions and the instructions for adding a spin button.

{panel end}

Write a program to simulate a Bee-Bot, which can be programmed with five commands (forward, left, right, back, pause). Pressing the four commands stores them in a list called "source code", and pressing the GO button will activate a script that goes through the list of commands and moves the cat according to each command.

The HOME button returns the cat to the starting position; the UNDO button removes the last command from the list; and the CLEAR button empties the list.

A project with the graphics needed is provided at [scratch.mit.edu/projects/159722851/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/159722851/), but you will need to write the program to make it work
