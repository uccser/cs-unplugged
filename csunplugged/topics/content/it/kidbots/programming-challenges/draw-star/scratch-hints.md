There will be a few ways to do this. Below are hints for three different ways you can program this.

- **Solution 1:** By drawing a hexagon inside a star (see [challenge 7.2]('topics:programming_challenge' 'unplugged-programming' 'draw-star-with-odd-points')).

- **Solution 2:** By drawing 6 triangles;
    
    1. draw a triangle,
    2. move back to the last vertex drawn,
    3. turn 60 degrees (as if you are drawing a hexagon)
    4. repeat steps 1-3 6 times).

- **Solution 3:** By drawing 2 triangles.
