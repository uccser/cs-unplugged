Create a necklace or a bag tag with your initials written in 5 bit binary.

Decide on which bead colour will be a 1 and which bead will be a 0. Computers don’t need to know when a new letter starts because it knows the rule that every 5th bit is a new letter. The lowest value bit of each group of 5 goes on the right.
