-   Make a variable called “number of dots” and change its value by using an
    operator (multiplying it by 2 before displaying it on the screen each time).
    You can find “make a new variable” under “data” script to create a new
    variable.
    Make sure your variable name is as descriptive as possible.
-   Use the `scratch:set [number of dots v] to [1]` block to set the value of
    your new variable.
    Use the `scratch:() * ()` operation under “Operators” to double the value of
    your variable.
-   Display the value of your variable on the screen by replacing
    “Hello” in your `scratch:say [Hello] for (2) secs` block with your new
    variable.
