# Display Binary Numbers (using variables as an operator)

## Requirement:

Write a program to display numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 on the screen one at a
time.
This is similar to the previous challenge, but instead of storing a number
directly into the variable, you should double the value in the variable each
time.
You need to use an operator (for multiplying 2 numbers) for this challenge.
