-   Make a variable called `total_number_of_dots` and set its value to 0.
-   Make another variable called `number_of_dots` and set its value to 16.
-   Add the value of `number_of_dots` to the value of `total_number_of_dots`
    every time the end user enters ‘W’ as the input.
    Repeat this 5 times dividing the value of `number_of_dots` by 2 each time and
    convert the result to an integer using int().
-   Display the `total_number_of_dots` as the output.
-   Use a for loop to repeat this five times
