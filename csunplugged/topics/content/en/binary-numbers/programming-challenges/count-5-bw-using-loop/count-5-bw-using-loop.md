# Count dots on 5 black and white cards (using a loop)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the end user to enter 5 black and white cards
representing bits ('B' for black and 'W' for white which are entered one at a
time) and displays the total number of dots as the output.
Use a loop for this challenge, so it could be changed to work for a different
number of cards.
