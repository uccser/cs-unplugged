-   Make a variable called “number of dots” and set it to the largest number
    of dots entered as the input.
    Divide the value of “number of dots” by 2 and display the result as the
    output until “number of dots” is equal to 1.
-   Use the `scratch:() / ()` operation under “Operators” to divide the
    value of your variable by 2.
-   Use the `scratch:repeat until <>` block to run the blocks inside while the
    condition is true.
    In this challenge you need to repeat the blocks until number of dots is
    equal to 1.
