-   Make a variable called “number_of_dots” and set it to the largest number
    of dots entered as the input.
-   Divide the value of “number_of_dots” by 2 and display the result as the
    output while “number_of_dots” is greater than or equal to 1.
-   Use a while loop to run the lines inside while the condition is true.
    In this challenge you need to repeat the lines while number of dots is
    greater than or equal to 1.
