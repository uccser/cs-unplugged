# Convert a positive decimal number to a binary number

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter any decimal number as the input
and displays the binary cards representing that number using '1' for dots
showing and '0' for not showing as the output (this converts the decimal
number to binary).
Do this by working out the largest bit value needed, and then working down
through smaller bit values.

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given
inputs provided:

| Input | Output                                                |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 31    | The binary representation for the number 31 is 11111  |
| 32    | The binary representation for the number 32 is 100000 |
| 1     | The binary representation for the number 1 is 1       |
