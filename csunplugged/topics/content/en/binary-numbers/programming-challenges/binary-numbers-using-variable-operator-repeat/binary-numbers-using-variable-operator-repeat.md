# Display Binary Numbers (using a variable, operator and a repeat loop)

## Requirement:

Write a program to display numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 on the screen one at a
time.
This challenge builds on the previous one, but the program should use a loop,
so it could easily be updated to display more numbers.
