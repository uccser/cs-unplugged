-   Make a variable called “total number of dots” and set it to 0.
    Add the corresponding number of dots (16 for the first input, 8 for the
    second input and so on) to the “total number of dots” every time the end
    user enters ‘W’ as the input.
    You would need to use 5 'If' blocks for this challenge.
-   Use the 'Set variable to' block to set the value of your new
    variable.
    Use the 'Add' block under “Operators” to add to the
    value of your variable.
-   The 'If' block checks if the condition is true and then
    runs the blocks inside of the if block.
