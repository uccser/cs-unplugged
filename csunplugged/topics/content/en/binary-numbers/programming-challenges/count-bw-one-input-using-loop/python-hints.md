-   Make variables called:

    -   `total_number_of_dots` and set its value to 0.
    -   `number_of_dots` and set its value to 1. You will need to multiply
        number_of_dots by 2 each time you go through the loop
    -   `cards` and set its value to the string entered as the input.
        Check each letter of the input string `cards` (use a loop to iterate
        the number of letters in the input) starting from the last letter.
        If it’s ‘W’ add the corresponding number of dots (1 for the last
        letter, 2 for the second to last letter and so on) to the `total
        number of dots`.
        Display the `total_number_of_dots` as the output.
    -   `i` and set its value to the number of letters in the input minus 1.
        Use this variable to access a letter at the `i` position in the
        string.

-   You can access a letter at the specified position in a string by using
    brackets, like cards[i]

-   In this challenge you need to access all the letters in user’s input and
    check to see if each of them is equal to B (black) or W (white).

-   You can find how many letters a string has by using ` len(cards)`

-   In this challenge you need to check if each letter of the input is equal
    to ‘W’ or `B’ using and if statement
