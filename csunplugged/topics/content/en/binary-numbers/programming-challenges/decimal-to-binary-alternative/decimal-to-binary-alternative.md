# Convert a decimal number to a binary number (alternative method)

## Requirement:

Using a different method from “Binary challenge 7.3”, write a program that
asks the user to enter any decimal number as the input and displays the
binary cards representing that number using '1' for dots showing and '0' for
not showing as the output (this converts the decimal number to binary).
This method generates the number from right to left by observing that an even
number has a 0 on the right, and an odd number as a 1 on the right.
