-   Make variables called:

    -   “number of dots” to store the number of dots 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 where each
        number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.
    -   “binary cards” to store a set of strings “1, 2, 4, 8, 16,” and displays it
        as the output.

-   Use the `scratch:(join [hello] [world])` block under “Operators” to
    combine two strings. You can use multiple join blocks inside each other if
    you need to combine more than two strings.
-   In Scratch, to concatenate data together you use the
    `scratch:(join [hello] [world])` blocks.
    This can be used to join text, variables and calculations.
    Remember to check if the spaces are correct between the items being joined!
-   Use the `scratch:repeat()` block to run the blocks inside a specified number
    of times.
    In this challenge you need to repeat the blocks 5 times (4 times for the
    extra challenge).
