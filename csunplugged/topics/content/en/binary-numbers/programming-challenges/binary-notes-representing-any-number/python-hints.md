-   Make variables called:

    -   `decimal_number` and set its value to the input number given by the
        end user.
    -   `bit_value` and set its value to 1.
        Find the smallest bit value which is larger than `decimal_number`
        by doubling value of `bit_value` until it is bigger than the `decimal_number`
        (by using a while loop while `bit_value` is less than or equal to `decimal_number`).

-   Set the variable `bit_value` to 1 and find the smallest `bit_value` which
    is larger than `decimal_number` by multiplying `bit_value` by 2
    until it is larger than `decimal number`.
    You can do this by using a while loop.
-   Now divide the `bit_value` by 2 and check if `decimal_number` is greater
    than or equal to `bit_value`.
    If it is, print "high" for a high note and subtract `bit_value` from `decimal_number`.
    If not, print "low" for a low note.
    Repeat until `bit_value` is equal to 1 (by using a while loop while `bit_value`
    is greater than 1)
