# Display Binary Numbers (using a variable)

## Requirement:

Write a program to display numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 on the screen one at a
time for 1 second each.
Instead of displaying the number directly, you should
store it into a variable, and display the variable.

## Testing examples:

The output will always show the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 (there is no input).
