-   Use the 'Say' block and the 'Number' block to display on the screen what you want.
    In this case, it will be ‘1’ for the first output, ‘2’ for the second, ‘4’ for
    the third and so on.

-   Make sure all your blocks are “snapped” together in a line like a jigsaw puzzle.

-   Whenever you click the Run button, your program will start.
