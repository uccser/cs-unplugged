-   Make a variable called “number of cards” to store the number of cards to
    display entered by the end user as the input (e.g. 5) and a variable
    called “number of dots” to store the number of dots (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
    where each number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.

-   In this challenge, use the 'Ask and wait for number'
    block to receive an input from the user.
    Replace the text “What’s your age?” with your own question.
    You can then set the value of this block to the variable "number of cards"
    Use a 'Repeat' loop, repeating the blocks inside (displaying the number of
    dots) “number of cards” times.
