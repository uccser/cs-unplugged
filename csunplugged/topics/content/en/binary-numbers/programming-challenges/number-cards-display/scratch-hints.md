- You can ask a question by using the `ASK` block.
  Replace the text `What’s your name?` with your own question.
  The user input will be stored in a predefined variable called `answer` after the check mark button is clicked or Enter key is pressed.
  You can view the value of `answer` by clicking the checkbox next to the answer block.
- You can find `make a new variable` under `data` script to create a new variable. 
  Make sure your variable name is as descriptive as possible.
- Use the `SET` block to set the value of your new variable.
  Use the multiply operation under `Operators` script to double the value of your variable. 
- Display the value of your variable on the screen by replacing “Hello” in your `SAY` block with your new variable. 
- Use the `REPEAT` block to run the blocks inside a specified number of times.
  In this challenge you need to repeat the blocks as many times as user’s input.
