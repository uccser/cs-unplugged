-   Make a variable called `number_of_cards` to store the number of cards to
    display entered by the end user as the input (e.g. 5) and a variable
    called `number of dots` to store the number of dots (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
    where each number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.

-   In this challenge, use the `input()` function to receive input from the
    user. Place text inside the brackets of input with your question. The user input
    will be stored whichever variable you assign it to. Set the value of variable
    `number_of_cards` to the input you received. Use a for loop, repeating the
    blocks inside (displaying the number of dots) `number_of_cards` times.
