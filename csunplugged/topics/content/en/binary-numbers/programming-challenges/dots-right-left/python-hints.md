-   Make variables:


    -   `number_of_cards` to store the number of cards to display entered by
        the end user as the input (e.g. 4).
    -   `number_of_dots` to store the number of dots.
    -   `binary_cards` which is a variable type string and stores what is
        going to be displayed on the screen as the output (e.g. "1, 2, 4, 8,").

-   Use the addition operator to combine strings. You can use multiple to combine
    multiple strings. Remember to check if the spaces are correct between the items
    being joined!
-   Use the `input()` function to get the user's input. You can place text
    inside the brackets of input if you'd like to display your question.
