-   Make variables:


    -   “number of cards” to store the number of cards to display entered by
        the end user as the input (e.g. 4).
    -   “number of dots” to store the number of dots.
    -   “binary cards” which is a variable type string and stores what is
        going to be displayed on the screen as the output (e.g. “1, 2, 4, 8,”).

-   Use the 'Join' block under “Operators” to combine
    two strings.
    You can use multiple join blocks inside each other if you need to combine
    more than two strings.
-   To concatenate data together you use the
    'Join' block.
    This can be used to join text and variables.
    Remember to check if the spaces are correct between the items being joined!
