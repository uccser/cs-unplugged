-   Click inside the `scratch:say [Hello] for (2) secs` block and type to change
    “Hello” to what you want to display on the screen.
    In this case, it will be ‘1’ for the first output, ‘2’ for the second, ‘4’ for
    the third and so on.

-   The number of seconds tells the output how long to show.
    The script waits that long before continuing.

-   Make sure all your blocks are “snapped” together in a line like a jigsaw puzzle.

-   Whenever you click the green flag, your script will start.
    To stop, click the stop button.
