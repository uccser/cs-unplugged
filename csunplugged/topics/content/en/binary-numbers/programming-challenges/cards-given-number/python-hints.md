-   Make a variable called `number_of_dots` and set its value to 1.
-   To multiply a number in Python, use the `*` symbol.
    For example: `2 * 3` is equal to `6`.
-   To double a variable's value, set the variable to be itself multiplied by 2.
    For example: If you have the variable `age` and it is set to `5`, you can
    double the variable with `age = age * 2`.
-   The `print()` statement allows you to display text or values within the
    parentheses on the screen.
    For example: `print(100)` would display `100` on the screen.
