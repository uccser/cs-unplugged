# Count dots on 5 black and white cards as one input (using a loop)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the end user to enter 5 black and white cards
representing bits, all as one input ('B' for black and 'W' for white), and
displays the total number of dots as the output.
Use a loop for this challenge, so it could be changed to work for a different
number of cards.
