# Reinforcing sequencing in binary number systems

## Key question

- How can you create a play to teach someone how binary works, without using the binary cards?

## Lesson starter

# Notes on resources

The classroom resources we suggested are highly motivating, however please use any resources you have available in your classroom that have two different states, sounds or sizes.

{panel end}

Computers use on and off to know how to display information or data.
We can use anything we like that is opposite to each other.

Today we will look at what opposites are and how we can count using these.
If I said “happy face” what would be the opposite?
What would the opposite be of cat? (This could be a mouse or a dog).

Introduce two opposite objects.
They could be paper plates, dual coloured counters, hats (to put on or off), or two different percussion instruments.

Your play must include a demonstration of one of the following:

-   How to count from 0 to 10 or more using binary dots.
-   How you would work out the number 5.

## Lesson activities

Brainstorm together items you could use to make the numbers.
It should be different to how it has been demonstrated to the class, so they are not allowed to use cards with dots on them.

In groups of 4 have students decide how they will show ON and OFF.
They need to choose which bit they are going to be.
(It may help to give them each their own bit card so they remember their number).
As well as physical representations like hats, it could be using words (e.g. saying "yes and no"), or musical sounds (high and low, long and short, loud and soft), or light.

8, 4, 2, 1

Have a chance to practise counting in their group from 1 to 8.

Once they have done that they change roles to they experience what it's like being each of the different bits:

-   The person with 8 takes on the job of 1
-   4 becomes 8
-   2 becomes 4
-   1 becomes 2

When they are ready ask each group to make the number (choose a random number between 0 and 8).

Your plays will typically need 4 students in a group to represent the four bits.
If the number of students isn't a multiple of 4, the extra students could take on roles such as taking photos or videos.
The roles can swap over so they have a turn at being a “bit” as well as capturing the learning.
Alternatively, a smaller group could explore other options, such as one student holding two bits, or using objects as bits on 4 chairs "operated" by the students, so one student can change all of them.

# Teaching observations

1.  The number pattern is from highest to lowest, left to right (it's just a convention, but we use the same one in the decimal number system, with the most significant digits on the left):

    *8, 4, 2, 1*

    Therefore watch that they haven’t switched the order of the place values, for example they check they aren’t representing the decimal number 1 as:

    *1, 0, 0, 0 (which actually represents the decimal number 8)*

2.  Below is an example of where students believed that 3 in decimal is represented as 0100, as they focused on the pattern of numbers rather than using the place values.
    *0001
    0010
    0100 (where it should be 00011 for 3)*

## Applying what we have just learnt

Reflect after each play is performed to reinforce learning by asking:

1.  How did they choose to show on and off?

2.  What made the plays interesting or appealing that another person might be able to learn from them?

## Lesson reflection

-   What did you clarify about the binary number system now that you’ve created your play?

-   What questions do you have after performing your play in relation to the binary number system? (
    Typically responses are that they want to understand further how binary numbers are used to show letters, images, videos and all things on a computer - these topics are covered in further lesson plans)
