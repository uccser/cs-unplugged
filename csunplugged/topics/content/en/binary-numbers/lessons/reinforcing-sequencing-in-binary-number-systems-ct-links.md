{panel type="ct-algorithm"}

# Algorithmic thinking

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Do students demonstrate how the binary number system works by explaining, systematically, what is happening to work out the binary representation of a given number?

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-abstraction"}

# Abstraction

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Ask students to look at a video created and  list the features of the objects used that are important to demonstrate the binary number system and those that aren’t relevant at all. e.g. using Maths teddy bears - having the back or front showing is important, the colour of the teddy isn’t important, the size of the teddy isn’t important.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-decomposition"}

# Decomposition

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Watch a video and ask students to point out one element in it that is decomposition e.g.  this could be when a single bit out of a group is determined to be on or off.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-pattern"}

# Generalising and patterns

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Have students review three videos and ask what do these videos have in common and what is different about them.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-logic"}

# Logic

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Finding errors or misconceptions in the videos may exercise some logical reasoning.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-evaluation"}

# Evaluation

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Have students consider the number of bits used in each demonstration, and the difference this makes in the range of values that can be represented.
