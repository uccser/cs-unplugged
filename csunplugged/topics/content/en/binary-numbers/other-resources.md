The [Computer Science Field Guide](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/) has a chapter on [Data Representation](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/data-representation.html) which covers Binary Numbers and how they can represent different different types of data.
It also has an interactive version of the [binary cards](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/binary-cards/index.html?digits=4&start=WWWW), you can find out extra information on how to use these [here](https://github.com/uccser/cs-field-guide/tree/develop/interactives/binary-cards).
