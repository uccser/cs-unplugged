# Algorithmic thinking

There are several important algorithms for students to learn and follow in
this unit.
These algorithms are solutions to the problems “How do we convert between
decimal and binary numbers?”, “How do we represent letters using binary
numbers?”, and “How do we convert a message written in a binary code back to
letters?”.
Students will be tasked with following these algorithms accurately,
articulating them, and explaining them.

{panel type="ct-abstraction"}

# Abstraction

Binary number representation is an abstraction that hides the complexity of the
electronics and hardware inside a computer that store data.
Abstraction helps us simplify things because we can ignore the details we don’t
currently need to know.

{panel type="ct-decomposition"}

# Decomposition

An example of decomposition is breaking the conversion of the number to binary
into one bit at a time.
The questions "Should this be 1 or 0" for each of the dot cards is decomposing
the problem to a series of questions.

{panel type="ct-pattern"}

# Generalising and patterns

Recognising patterns in the way the binary number system works helps give us a
deeper understanding of the concepts involved, and assists us in generalising
these concepts and patterns so that we can apply them to other problems.

{panel type="ct-logic"}

# Logic

Logical thinking means using rules you already know and using logic to deduce
more rules and information from these.
Once we know what number each of the binary cards represents then we can use
this knowledge to figure out how to represent other numbers with the cards.
If you memorise how to represent the numbers we can make with 5 cards, does
that mean you understand how to represent any number with any number of bits?
It doesn’t, but you can understand how to do that if you understand the logic
behind how these numbers with the 5 cards are made.

{panel type="ct-evaluation"}

# Evaluation

An example of evaluation is working out how many different values can be
represented by a given number of bits (e.g. 5 bits can represent 32 different
values), and vice versa (to represent 1000 different values, you need at least
10 bits).
