# Binary Tunes

- Use a high note for a 1, and a low note for a 0
- Represent letters using the binary numbers from 00001 to 11010 (1 to 26)
- This is explained in more detail here, with examples: [https://classic.csunplugged.org/modems-unplugged-2/](https://classic.csunplugged.org/modems-unplugged-2/)
- Steganography: is a message hidden in something else - in this case, a song
- Write your own song that contains a hidden message. 

#### Extension

Consider hiding the binary numbers in the rhythm (long and short notes), or make a video with dance moves that code binary numbers
