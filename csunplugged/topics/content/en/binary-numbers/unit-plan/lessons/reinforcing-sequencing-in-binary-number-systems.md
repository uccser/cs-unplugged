# Reinforcing sequencing in binary number systems

## Key question

-   How can you create a 60 second or less video to teach someone how binary works without using the binary cards?

## Lesson starter

# Notes on resources

The following items are highly motivating, however you can use any resources you have available in your classroom that have two different states or sizes.

- Playdough/plasticine
- Musical instruments
- Mathematics equipment such as mini teddy bears
- Glue a stick onto paper plates and have one side on and the other side off

There is also an online interactive version of the binary cards [here](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/binary-cards/index.html?digits=8), from the [Computer Science Field Guide](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/), but it is preferable to work with physical cards.

Teacher says to class: “We are going to create a video that shows binary
numbers in use.”

## Lesson activities

In this lesson students will make a video that gives instructions on how to
represent any given number in binary.
The video must include a demonstration of one of the following:

-   How to count from 0 to 8 or more using binary numbers.
-   How you would work out the number 22.

Brainstorm together items you could use to make this video with.
It should be different to how it has been demonstrated to the class, so they
are not allowed to just video cards with dots on them (but they may want to
use them to help with their planning).

Within the hour students will have taken the raw footage needed to make the
movie and imported it into a simple movie format using available software
like iMovie or StopMotion.

Early finishers can edit their work, add music and then be camera crew
for others.

Tips to relay before sending students off for the 60 minute challenge:

1.  The order of place values in a binary number is the same as the
conventional (decimal) place value system, so the highest is on the left, smallest value on the right.

2.  Make sure that if you are using colours or other representations there is a strong contrast.

# Teaching observations

1.  The number pattern is from highest to lowest, left to right (it's just a
    convention, but we use the same one in decimal, with the most significant
    digits on the left):

    *16, 8, 4, 2, 1*

    Therefore watch that they aren’t representing 1 as:

    *1, 0, 0, 0, 0* (which actually represents the decimal number 16)

2.  Below is an example of where students believed that 3 in decimal is
    represented as 00100, as they focused on the pattern of numbers rather
    than using the place values.

    *00001*

    *00010*

    *00100* (where it should be 00011 for 3)

3.  The videos below were made within 60 minutes, to provide you with
    realistic videos that your students can expand on.
    Like all completed work, there is always something you can improve on.
    It's very hard to get every detail exactly right when you are explaining
    things, so the important thing is that students are demonstrating that
    they have the big concepts, rather than getting every detail right;
    minor errors such as an incorrect number can be discussion points for
    other students.

## Applying what we have just learn

Review each other’s videos

1.  Can you recognise any misconceptions about the binary number system that
    have appeared in a video?

2.  What made the videos interesting or appealing that another person might
    be able to learn from them?

## Lesson reflection

-   How can you use these videos to support others to learn about the
    binary number system?
-   What were the key points that are now clear about the binary number
    system now that you’ve created your video?
-   What questions do you have after making this video in relation to the
    binary number system?
    (Typically responses are that they want to understand further how binary
    numbers are used to show letters, images, videos and all things
    on a computer - these topics are covered in further lesson plans)
