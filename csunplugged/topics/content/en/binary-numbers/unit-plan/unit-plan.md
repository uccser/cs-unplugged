# Binary numbers

Computers today use digits to represent information - that's why they're called digital systems.
The simplest and most common way to represent digits is the binary number system, with just two digits (usually written as 0 and 1).
It is called binary because there are only two different digits used, or two states.

A bit is usually stored in a memory cell inside a computer, which is an electronic circuit that can be set to a high voltage level (1) or a low voltage level (0); on disks they are represented by magnetism or optical reflection.

There are billions of these bits on a typical computer, and they are used to store text, numbers, images, video, and anything else that we need to store or transmit. On computer networks the bits are communicated by light, voltages or sound.
Anything that can have two different values can represent a bit!

## Digital Technologies | Data Representation

The binary number system plays a central role in how information of all kinds is stored on computers.
Understanding binary representation can lift a lot of the mystery from computers, because at a fundamental level they’re really just machines for flipping binary digits on and off.
Computers are simple machines, and they need very exact instructions to make them do complex tasks.

Teaching binary numbers as an introduction to computational thinking introduces students to {glossary-link term="algorithm"}algorithms{glossary-link end} and decomposition, as they learn to break down the problems of calculating binary numbers and converting between binary and {glossary-link term="decimal-number"}decimal numbers{glossary-link end}, into step by step processes that they can follow to solve these problems; it also introduces abstraction, as students learn that two different things can be used to represent any and all information.
It shows them that a computer isn’t actually that complex, and we use simple concepts in a clever way to make computers do extraordinary things!

##  Vocabulary Explained

### Binary Digits

Each zero or one is called a bit. Bit is an abbreviation for Binary Digit.

### Bytes

8 bits grouped together are called a byte, and computers store data in bytes.
A byte is a convenient number of bits as it can store things like simple characters, small numbers, and a useful range of colours, although usually information is stored using groups of bytes.

# Mathematical links

The binary number system is base 2, so there are only two digits before you need to move to the next place value: 0, 1.

Humans normally use the decimal number system, which is base 10, so there are ten digits before you move to the next place value: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

## Real World Implications

{image file-path="img/topics/col_binary_01.png" alignment="right"}

- The number of bits used to represent characters in text affects the range of characters available; a short representation is more compact, but can't represent characters from all languages.

- The number of bits used to represent colours in images affects how accurate the colours are.

- The number of bits used to store sound samples affects the quality of the sound or images.

- When designing a new application (perhaps storing genetic data or representing smells), the right number of bits to store a symbol needs to be selected - enough to be accurate, but not so many that it's wasteful.

- In encryption and security applications, the more bits in a security key, the more secure it is.

- When you purchase a device, measurements in bits relate to how much memory it has and how much data can be stored on different external storage devices.

- Working with only two digits makes it much easier to build reliable circuitry for digital devices.
