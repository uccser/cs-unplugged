As we use computers more and more, and the amount of data we use increases, we
want them to process information as quickly as possible.
One way to increase the speed of a computer is to write programs that use fewer
computational steps (as shown in the lessons on sorting and searching
algorithms).
Another way to solve problems faster is to have several computers work on
different parts of the same task at the same time, which is what this unit
explores.
Unfortunately it's not always that simple to just split the work among separate
processors!

Sorting Networks are used to sort values into ascending order by comparing pairs
of values; unlike a conventional sorting algorithm, a Sorting Network can have
more than one comparison happening at the same time.
For example, in the six-number Sorting Network that we use a lot in this unit,
a total of 12 comparisons are used to sort the numbers, but up to three
comparisons can be performed simultaneously.
This means that the time required will be the same as what one computer by itself
would take to make only 5 comparison steps.
It's a bit like the situation where you might need to type in 4 pages of
writing; if you have 4 people typing at the same time on 4 computers, then you
can probably get the typing done 4 times faster than if one person did all the
work.

A parallel Sorting Network enables us to explore how much faster we can sort
values into order if we can make simultaneous comparisons.
The main six-way parallel network used in these lessons sorts a list of values
more than twice as quickly as a system that can only perform one comparison at
a time.

Not all tasks can be completed faster by using parallel computation however.
As an analogy, imagine one person digging a ditch ten metres long.
If ten people each dug one metre of the ditch at the same time the task would
be completed much faster.
However, the same strategy could not be applied to a ditch ten metres deep, the
second metre is not accessible until the first metre has been dug.

{image file-path="img/topics/sorting-network-confused-people.png" alt="A group of people are confused in front of computers as they try to coordinate a simple job across many people."}

And for typing our four page document, if you have 400 people helping, you'll
probably spend so much time coordinating all the work that it might not be very
fast at all!
Computer Scientists are still actively trying to find the best ways to break
problems up so that they can be solved by computers working in parallel, finding
out how much, and which parts, of the computation can be done at the same time,
and which parts have to be done one after another.

In these lessons we use a fun team activity to demonstrate an approach to
parallel sorting.
It can be done on paper, but we like to get students to do it on a large scale,
running from node to node in the network.

As an aside, although this is called a "network", it is only one of many
different types of networks that we encounter in Computer Science.
A common kind of “network” is a communication network, such as the
telecommunication networks that mobile phones use, and of course the Internet!
There are also networks for representing things like road maps and airline
routes.
It’s important to recognise that the Sorting Network in this activity is **not**
one of these types of networks, it is called a comparator network, because it’s
a network where each node compares two values, rather than linking different
devices (such as phones and computers) together.

## Digital Technologies | Algorithms

{image file-path="img/topics/sorting-network-too-far-kid.png" alt="A child walks too far in the sorting network activity, failing the activity for everyone."}

To use the Sorting Network students need to follow a simple algorithm and should
recognise that if they do not follow this algorithm precisely, the way a
computer would, then they will probably not get to a correct result, or may not
get a result at all!
Students will be working collaboratively to ensure that each part of the
algorithm is coordinated, because if one person moves too far ahead, without
stopping at the nodes they are meant to, it causes the process to fail for
everyone.
There are also many algorithms that are used to construct extremely efficient
Sorting Networks of different sizes, and Computer Scientists study these to try
and create even better ones.
These can be very complex however, so when students construct their own networks
they will be doing this in a simplified way.

## Vocabulary explained

-   **Processor/CPU:** A device that can run computer programs.
-   **Parallel processing:** Using multiple processors to work on different
    parts of a problem at the same time.
-   **Serial processing:** Running a program on a single processor, so all the
    instructions are executed one after the other.
-   **Network:** A series of connected nodes such as a computer network, a road
    map, or a comparator network.
-   **Computational step:** A basic operation that is part of an algorithm.
-   **GPU/Graphics Processing Unit:** A specialised processor in a computer that
    can do simple operations for the many pixels in an image in parallel.
    These are often used for other computations because of their ability to do
    parallel processing.

This activity strongly supports learning about the concept of before and after
(ordering) for numbers, including determining the relationship between two
numbers (greater than, less than).

## Real world implications

{image file-path="img/topics/sorting-network-tortoises-vs-rabbit.png" alt="A group of turtles build a wall quicker than one rabbit."}

Often it's cheaper, and faster, to have a number of slow processors work on a
computational problem, rather than one very fast one.
Companies that have massive cloud servers often find it more economical to have
many slower, cheaper devices rather than fewer expensive ones.
Of course, this requires you to be able to split up a computational task over
several processors.
For some computational problems that's very easy to do, and for others it's
impossible.
The task we will be looking at here is between these extremes.

Having such a small operation (comparing two values) split over multiple
devices means that this kind of algorithm needs to run on special hardware.
It is only used for specialist applications at present, but, for example, it is
sometimes done on the graphics processor (GPU) of a computer, because these
processors are good at doing parallel computation of simple tasks.

Sorting Networks were invented long before powerful GPUs came along; this is an
exciting thing about Computer Science - some of our discoveries are ahead
of the hardware that is available, so we're ready for the hardware if it does
become commonly available!
Note that the approach explored in these lessons is **not** a conventional
sorting algorithm, as the sorting that is done on a conventional system can make
only one comparison at a time; conventional sorting algorithms are explored in
another lesson.
The main goal of these lessons is to help students explore the tradeoffs between
spreading work over several processors instead of using one processor.

One approach to parallel computation that is currently popular is called
"MapReduce", which is widely used in Cloud Computing systems where large amounts
of computing are spread over a large number of processors.

## Reflection questions

-   What was most surprising about the learning that happened from the teaching
    of this unit?
-   Who were the students that were very systematic when working through the
    activities?
-   Who were the students who were very detailed in their activities?
-   What would I change in my delivery of this unit?
