# Algorithmic thinking

In these lessons students will be sorting a variety of things into order, but
the underlying algorithm for performing these tasks will remain the same.
It is an algorithm because it is a step-by-step process that will always give
the right solution, as long as it is followed exactly.
In this case it is a special class of algorithm called a "parallel algorithm".
Students will need to follow this algorithm precisely to get to the correct
solution (this is particularly clear when students try to ‘cheat’ by dashing
straight to the end of the network, and then realise this means other students
are now stuck in the middle!
It’s a great learning opportunity when someone does this).

# Abstraction

The Sorting Network we use in these activities is a simple representation of
something much more complex: how Sorting Networks are implemented using specific
hardware and software on some computers to perform parallel processing.
The lines, circles, and squares we will use in our Sorting Networks hide the
complicated details of the hardware and software.

Another detail we can ignore when we are using a Sorting Network is what the
data we are sorting actually is, or represents.
It doesn’t matter if we are sorting numbers into order, or words, or musical
notes, we will still follow the same process each time.
The one thing about the data that does matter however is that we can compare
each item and that they have a precise way of being ordered (e.g. alphabetical
order).
This is described further in the section on logic.

The overall idea of a Sorting Network is actually an abstract concept as well,
this is explained under the generalisation heading.

# Decomposition

In order to create an algorithm that can solve computational problems
effectively using parallel processors, we must first be able decompose the task
into very small and basic operations that, when repeated many times, can build
up a solution to the problem.
This operation is what will be performed by each processor in the network.
For the Sorting Network in these lessons this basic operation is the comparison
of two values that we perform at each node.
These operations need to be so basic that nodes can perform them simultaneously
and independently.
Parallel algorithms work best for tasks that need to do repetitive, and
independent, calculations with large amounts of data.

Decomposition is one of the most important steps in creating parallel processing
algorithms!

# Generalising and patterns

There are many links between this section and the abstraction section above, see
if you can spot them!

The Sorting Networks we will look at are each constructed to take in a specific
number of inputs, and that number only.
We can’t use a Sorting Network that sorts 6 numbers to sort 10 numbers instead.
However the generalised idea of a Sorting Network can be applied to different
problems.
The generalised concept of a Sorting Network is simply a comparator network
(comparator just means it makes comparisons, like how we compare numbers in each
of the circles in the network) that takes in a number of inputs, and sorts them
into order.
This general idea of a Sorting Network can then be applied to solving many
different problems, by creating a Sorting Network for the specific number of
inputs needed for the problem and placing its comparison nodes in a specific
pattern.

There are patterns in the layout of Sorting Networks as well; recognising these
helps us design larger networks.
For example, the (optimal) two-way, four-way and six-way Sorting Networks follow
a similar pattern in their layout.
A simple pattern for generating Sorting Networks is explored at the end of
lesson 3 for ages 11-14 (but this can be used with any age group if the students
are interested!).

There is also a common pattern that students can observe between all the
different types of information we sort with the Sorting Network, which is that
they can be compared and ordered in a precise way.
This is described in the logic section.

{panel type="ct-evaluation"}

# Evaluation

Parallel systems need to be evaluated for correctness: do they always sort
values correctly?
They also need to be evaluated for efficiency: how much time does this network
arrangement take to sort values, and is there a faster arrangement we could use?
Could this problem be solved easier by a non-parallel system?

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-logic"}

# Logic

A very important rule for the data that Sorting Networks can process is the data
must have something called a transitive relation.
The transitive relation means: if 'a' is less than 'b', and 'b' is less than 'c', then 'a' is less than 'c'.
For example, numbers have a transitive relation: the number 5 is less than 10,
and 10 is less than 15, which means that 5 must also be less than 15.
Data must have this relation for a Sorting Network to be able to sort it.
If items don’t have this relation then there is no logical way for us to order
it!

We will also see that Sorting Networks can't be evaluated by trying every
possible input (well they could be, but it could take hours, days, or even
hundreds of years for big networks!), unless a very small amount of data is
being sorted.
So instead, we must apply logic and reason to prove why it will always sort the
data correctly.
In these lessons we don't get into the advanced proofs that the whole network
will work, but students can apply their logical thinking skills to prove that
the smallest and largest values will always end up in the correct place.
