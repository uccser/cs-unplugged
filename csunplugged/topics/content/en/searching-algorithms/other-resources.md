The [Computer Science Field Guide](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/) has a chapter on Algorithms which covers Searching and Sorting Algorithms in more detail.
It also has online interactives of the searching activities, with numbers in [random orders](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/searching-algorithms/index.html?max=2) and in [sorted order](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/searching-algorithms/index.html?level=3).
