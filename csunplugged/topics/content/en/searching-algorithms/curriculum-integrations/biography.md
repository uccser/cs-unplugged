The most famous book on searching algorithms was written by [Don Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), a mathematician and computer scientist.

The book was started in 1962, and is called [The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming).
Volume 3 is entirely about Sorting and Searching.
He has several interests outside of computer science, including calligraphy and playing the organ.

The first mention of the binary search algorithm seems to have been made by [John Mauchly](http://history-computer.com/People/MauchlyBio.html).

Search engines, which use algorithms to search the entire world wide web, were developed by many people, but one of the most famous search engines was developed by [Sergey Brin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin) and [Larry Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page).

[Hans Peter Luhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Peter_Luhn) is generally credited with first using the term "hash" for the idea behind hash searching.
He invented many things, including the check digit algorithm that is still used for the check digit on credit cards, and the "Key Word In Context" (KWIC) index.
