# Product code check digits

## Key questions

How many people do you know check their dockets at the supermarket or in a shop to be sure that what they purchased matches the docket?

## Potential answers could include:

- Typically it’s not many, and that is because the barcode system is so reliable that we trust that it works.

# Preparatory knowledge

It is helpful, but not essential, for students to have done the [lesson on the Modulo operator]('topics:lesson' 'unplugged-programming' 'numeracy-unit-plan' 'modulo') before doing this lesson.

Explain to your class that you can calculate what the last digit will be on a
12 or 13 digit product code (the number on a bar code).
Have someone find a barcode on a product for you (e.g. some stationery or food
item) and tell you all the digits except the last one (sometimes the digits
have gaps or are before and after the bar code, so they may need to read
carefully to get all digits in the right order; also, some small items have
8-digit codes, and it's best to avoid these for now).

If 13-digit codes are common in your country, use the following guide,
otherwise skip to the 12-digit guide below.

## Lesson activities

### 13-digit instructions

Here’s an example of how to calculate the last digit on a 13-digit barcode.
It's a somewhat odd process of adding and multiplying numbers, but the same
formula will always give you the correct value for the 13th digit, as long as
there isn't an error in the number!

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-13.jpg" alt="A barcode with the digits 9 400547 009879."}

The above example barcode is from a product that a student might have selected,
so they would give you these 12 digits (they should keep the 13th digit
secret):

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-13-step-1.png" alt="63050942483."}

However, instead of writing it out as above, write it on the board with every
second digit on alternating lines:

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-13-step-2.png" alt="Top line has the digits 600443 and the bottom line has 35928."}

What you are doing is writing the numbers in an odd position at the top and
the even positions in the second row.

Now add up all the numbers in the first row (= 29) and take the number in
the ones column only.
(Later we will introduce a shortcut, where you only need to keep the last
digit after each addition e.g. 9+5 gives 4; for older classes you could
introduce this now through the lesson on modulo arithmetic.
Using only the last digit can seem too easy to them, and can challenge their
thinking!)

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-13-step-3.png" alt="6+0+0+4+4+3=17."}

Next add up all the numbers in the second row (to get 24), and again take the
number in the ones column only.

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-13-step-4.png" alt="4+0+4+0+9+7=24."}

Multiply the digit from the second sum by three i.e. the 4 in the 24 is
multiplied by 3, but take the ones column answer only (the 2).
With 13-digit barcodes, the units digit from the second row sum is always
multiplied by three.

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-13-step-5.png" alt="3x4=12."}

Add the result from the first sum to the multiplied answer (in this case,
the 9 from the 29 to the 2 from the 12):

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-13-step-6.png" alt="9+2=11."}

Once again, we only need the last digit; in the example it's a 1.
Now ask what you need to add to that digit to get a 0 in the ones column (i.e.
it will add up to either 0 or 10).
In this case, we ask what plus 1 = 10?
The answer, 9, gives us the checksum, which is the 13th number in the product
code.
If the brown total above had ended with a 0, then the checksum would be 0
(since that adds to give a 0 in the ones digit).

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-13-step-7.png" alt="The checksum is 9."}

This number should be the final digit on the product code.
Ask the student if you got the right one.
Of course, at this stage there's a small chance you guessed it, but now they
can explore the codes themselves, and they'll soon find out that it always
works if the number is copied correctly.

{panel type="teaching"}

# Teaching observations

Check that students notice to multiply the second line by 3 and take the last
digit of that number.
If the final number doesn't match the one that was expected, then the product
code had an error in it (which is a nice illustration of error detection at
work - either you wrote it wrong, or the student read it out incorrectly),
or you had an error in the calculations (which wouldn't happen on a computer,
but at least it provides a chance for the class to use their basic maths
facts!).

### 12-digit instructions

Here’s an example of how to calculate the last digit on a 12-digit barcode.
It's a somewhat odd process of adding and multiplying numbers, but the same
formula will always give you the correct value for the 12th digit, as long as
there isn't an error in the number!

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-12.jpg" alt="A barcode with the digits 6 30509 42483 2."}

The above example barcode is from a product that a student might have
selected, so they would give you these 11 digits:

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-12-step-1.png" alt="940054700987."}

However, instead of writing as above, write it on the board with every
second digit on alternating lines:

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-12-step-2.png" alt="Top line has the digits 600443 and the bottom line has 35928."}

What you are doing is writing the numbers in an odd position at top and the
even positions in the second row.

Now add up all the numbers in the first row by drawing plus signs between
each digit (in the example this will give 17), and take the number in the
ones column only.
(Later we will introduce a shortcut, where you only need to keep the last
  digit after each addition e.g. 6+4 gives 0; for older classes you could
  introduce this now through the lesson on modulo arithmetic.
Using only the last digit can seem too easy to them, and can challenge
their thinking!)

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-12-step-3.png" alt="6+0+0+4+4+3=17."}

Next add up all the numbers in the second row (to get 27), and again take
the number in the ones column only.

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-12-step-4.png" alt="3+5+9+2+8=27."}

Multiply the digit from the first sum by three i.e. the 7 in the 17 is
multiplied by 3, but take the ones column answer only (the 1 from the 21).
With 12-digit barcodes, the units digit from the first row sum is always
multiplied by three.

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-12-step-5.png" alt="3x7=21."}

Add the multiplied answer to the second sum (in this case, the 1 from the 21 to the 7 from the 27):

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-12-step-6.png" alt="9+2=11."}

Once again, we only need the last digit; in the example it's a single
digit already (8).
Now ask what you need to add to that digit to get a 0 in the ones column
(i.e. it will add up to either 0 or 10).
In this case, we ask what plus 8 = 10?
The answer, 2, gives us the checksum, which is the 12th number in
the product code.
If the brown total above had ended with a 0, then the check digit would be
0 (since that adds to give a 0 in the ones digit).

{image file-path="img/topics/barcode-12-step-7.png" alt="The checksum is 2."}

This number should be the final digit on the product code.
Ask the student if you got the right one.
Of course, at this stage there's a small chance you guessed it, but now
they can explore the codes themselves, and they'll soon find out that it
always works if the number is copied correctly.

# Teaching observations

Check that students notice to multiply the first line by 3 and take the
last digit of that number.
If the final number doesn't match the one that was expected, then the
product code had an error in it (which is a nice illustration of error
detection at work - either you wrote it wrong, or the student read it
out incorrectly), or you had an error in the calculations (which wouldn't
happen on a computer, but at least it provides a chance for the class to use
their basic maths facts!)

## Checking a barcode

In the activity above we worked out the value of the final digit.
When a barcode is scanned, an easy way to check the digits is to add the check
digit to the total, and make sure that the sum ends with a 0
(since that's how the check digit was calculated).

This time you can ask students to check some product codes - ask them to
choose a product with a product code on it (typically a stationery item around
the room will be suitable; many books have 13-digit product codes that
are suitable too).
To simplify how we think about this, we will now express it by adding the
values up backwards.
(This approach will work for both 12- and 13-digit barcodes).

Have students start at the end of the barcode, and write down every second
digit (starting with the last one).
That line is added up (you only need to keep the last digit, but out of
  interest, keep the whole sum).

Then write down every second digit starting at the second to last one.
These digits are summed and multiplied by three, again keeping the whole sum.

Now add the two sums together. If the digits are correct then the total should
sum to a number ending with 0.

Try out different product codes to check that they sum to a number ending in
zero (or if you keep only the last digit from each calculation along the way,
the final value will be zero.)

Now try changing one digit in a valid product code, and see if the total is
non-zero i.e. you can detect the error.
Is there any single digit that you can change in a product code that will
still result in the zero as the total? (This won't be possible).
Are there any two digits that you can change that will give a zero total?
(If one digit change happens to counteract another one, then this can happen,
but it's a rare situation).
If two wrong digits do happen to counteract each other, the error will go
undetected, although the product code will be so incorrect that when the
computer goes to look it up, chances are it's not going to find a product with
that number anyway.

Have students check more product codes. Do they all add up to a multiple of 10?

## Applying what we have just learnt

There needs to be a system around the checksum to make sure that the people
using it know when the checksum worked and when it didn’t.
How do checkout systems let the operator know if there was an error in the
scanning?
(Typically with an error sound).

If the packaging has been damaged or is bent, it may not be possible to read
the bars accurately (it keeps giving errors), so the operator has to type in
the numbers.

What kind of errors can be made if a person types in the numbers?
The main type of answers to look for are:

-   A digit has its value changed.
-   Two adjacent digits are swapped with each other.
-   A digit is inserted in the number.
-   A digit is removed from the number.
