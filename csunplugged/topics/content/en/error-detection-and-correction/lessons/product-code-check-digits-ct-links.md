# Algorithmic thinking

The steps we follow to calculate the barcode checksum is an Algorithm.
We follow this same Algorithm every time we want to create a checksum for a
barcode, and every time we want to check if there is an error in a barcode.
It specifies exactly how we should do this, and students practice algorithmic
thinking as they follow and articulate this algorithm.

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Can your students write instructions that allow someone else to calculate the
barcode checksum of different products with the same number of digits in their
barcodes (e.g. 12)?
What about instructions that can be used for any different product, regardless
of the number of digits?

{panel type="ct-abstraction"}

# Abstraction

When a barcode goes through a scanner the scanner reads the black and white
bars on the barcode, whereas when a human looks at a barcode they will read
the digits.
The numbers on the barcode and the black and white bars both represent the
same thing though - a numeric code that identifies a product, and the bars
are an abstracted representation of these numbers.

When we are calculating the checksum we also don’t need to think about what
product it actually represents is, we just want to find out whether or not
the barcode is correct and all we need to do that is the barcode itself.

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Can your students explain how both of these represent the product?
Can they explain the reason for the different representations?

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-decomposition"}

# Decomposition

To check the product code, the task of calculating the checksum is broken
down into individual steps: adding one number at a time; doing that for
each subset of digits.
By doing this we are decomposing the problem into smaller subtasks which are
easier to solve than the overall problem of “Is this barcode correct?”.
Each time we solve one of these subtasks we move on to the next and move
closer to a solution.

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Are students able to independently break the calculation into the two halves,
and then perform the additions on each group of values, and combine them
to get the checksum?
Can they do this for a range of different codes with different errors in them?

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-pattern"}

# Generalising and patterns

The same method can apply to shorter (e.g. 8-digit) and longer product codes.
If you look at some courier packages you might see much larger bar codes,
and these use similar error detection techniques.
To check each of these bar codes we follow the same algorithmic pattern of
using the numbers on the code (except for the last one) and applying a
mathematical formula to these to get the final digit (or what it should be
if there are no errors!).

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Can students apply the algorithm (the version starting at the right hand end)
to different length product codes?
Do they appreciate how it still checks the digits in each case?
(You can find different codes by searching for images of barcodes online).

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-evaluation"}

# Evaluation

This error detecting process isn't perfect.
To evaluate its effectiveness we need to thoroughly test it.
Ask students what the different ways we need to test the algorithm are.
Interestingly it is not enough to just test it with a bunch of different
barcodes with one number in them changed, we need to test a range of
different types of errors as well!
For example what if instead of one number changing two of the numbers are
switched around?
What if two numbers are changed?
Are there any situations where we couldn’t figure out if something had changed?

This is an example of an important technique used when evaluating algorithms
and programs, called edge case testing.

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Can students demonstrate what kind of errors the checksum is guaranteed
to detect?
Can they give examples of errors that a human might make when typing in a
number that wouldn't be detected?
Can they work out how likely it is that an error will go undetected in each
of these cases?
They can do this by trial and error or by logical reasoning.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-logic"}

# Logic

The algorithm is designed to be sensitive to the type of errors that are
most likely to happen.

We can also evaluate the algorithm using logical thinking.

#### Examples of what you could look for:

Can students explain the logic that was applied in the process of
designing a barcode checksum, and especially the choice to multiply some
of the numbers by 3?

In cases where the checksum is unable to detect and error can students
explain logically why the error cannot be detected?
