Richard Hamming was one of the first people to come up with ideas for detecting and correcting errors on computers, and Claude Shannon developed these and related ideas so much that he became known as the "father of information theory".
Both lived in the 20th century, but their ideas are used on every 21st century digital device to make it reliable and efficient.
Below are the names of these and other people whose work in error detection and correction are key to modern digital devices.
We've given some links to Wikipedia below to get you started, but make sure you look more widely than that.

Some people to research about are:

- [Richard Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) (very early ideas in error control)

- [Hans Peter Luhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Peter_Luhn) (developed a checksum algorithm that is widely used, especially in bank and credit card numbers)
- [Irving S. Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_S._Reed) and [Gustave Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Solomon) (developed one of the most widely used error control codes, used on most digital devices)
