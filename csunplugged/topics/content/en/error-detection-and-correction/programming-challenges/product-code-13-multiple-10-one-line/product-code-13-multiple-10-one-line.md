# 13 digit product codes: Check if total is a multiple of 10 (one line of input)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter a 13 digit product code, all
in one line of input.
Then adds up all the digits, every second one multiplied by 3 (2nd, 4th, and
so on) and show if this total is a multiple of 10 (valid product code).
For this challenge make sure the user can only enter a 13 digit product code.
