# Check for odd/even numbers using repeated subtraction

## Requirement:

Create a program which asks the user to enter a number and checks if
the number is odd or even.
You should do this by keep subtracting 2 from your number until it is 0 or 1
(i.e. If it is 0 then the number is even and if it is 1 the number is odd).
Make sure your program works for negative numbers as well.
