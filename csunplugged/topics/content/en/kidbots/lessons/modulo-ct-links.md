This topic is primarily a maths topic, which supports later activities for
computational thinking.
The connections with Computational Thinking are therefore more indirect,
since CT isn't the main purpose of the topic, and so we haven't
provided the usual list of connections.

Nevertheless, there are some connections worth noting.
One connection with computational thinking is an example of **abstraction**:
sequences like "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday..." or "January, February,
March..." or "C, C#, D, D#, E, F..." can be represented by a
cycle of numbers (0, 1, 2, 3...).
There are also a lot of **patterns** for students to explore; for example,
using modulo 10, the result is always the last digit, and using modulo 2
the pattern for ascending numbers is 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1..., that is, it
alternates for even and odd numbers, and also corresponds to the right-hand
bit of the binary representation.
