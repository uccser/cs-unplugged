These programming challenges revolve around the "modulo" function ("mod" in Scratch, or "%" in some languages).
The modulo function occurs so much in Computer Science that we think it's worth exploring in its own right.
The exercises here correspond to some of the Unplugged modulo activities.
You'll also find programming exercises that use modulo in the exercises relating to hash tables for searching, the check digits for error detection.
