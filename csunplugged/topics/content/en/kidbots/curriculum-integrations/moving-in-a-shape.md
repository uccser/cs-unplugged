# Moving in a shape

Using the same structure and resources as the [Rescue Mission]('topics:lesson' 'kidbots' 'rescue-mission') lesson, we can integrate geometry with Kidbots.

## Key questions

-   How could thinking about programming help us to understand the features of a shape?
-   Why is it important to get the sequence right when drawing a shape?

## Lesson activity

Using a blank Kidbots grid, students should try to move the bot a particular shape.
For example:

- Move the object in the shape of a square that is 3 squares by 3 squares.
- Move the object in the shape of a rectangle that is 5 squares by 2 squares.

## Other challenges

Are there other ways we could have programmed the "Bot" to draw the square?
Discuss the programming options and test each one.
Possible answers could include doing the square backwards, or going over a line more than once.

Students can also be challenged to mark out other simple geometric shapes.

## Lesson reflection

Who are the students who can visualise what needs to be programmed?
