# Storytelling

Using the same structure and resources as the [Rescue Mission]('topics:lesson' 'kidbots' 'rescue-mission') lesson, we can retell a story using Kidbots.

## Key questions

-   How could thinking about programming help us to retell stories?
-   Why is it important to get the sequence right when retelling a story?

## Retelling the story

We’re going to write our own program that retells the story Little Red Riding Hood we just read.
But I’m going to mix up the story!

I’ve placed on my grid the main ideas from the story.

{image file-path="img/topics/kidbots-little-red-riding-hood-alternative-story.png" alt="An 8 by 8 grid with the following objects in different squares: A well, Grandma's house, Little Red Riding Hood, and a wolf."}

Let’s see what we have.

-   There’s a big bad wolf.
-   There’s Little Red Riding Hood
-   There’s Grandma’s house.
-   There’s also a well.

Once upon a time there was a misunderstood wolf, who everyone thought was unfriendly because he had big sharp scary teeth.
He was very shy and one day he heard a little girl skipping down the path and he needed to hide quickly, and the only place was to hide in the well.
The goal is to program the wolf to hide in the well.

# Teaching observations

Students may ask if they can program both Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf.
If they do that, have separate teams programming each character, or separate whiteboards for each character if the one team would like to try this.

Once students have completed the activity, ask them if they think this is a way they could plan out their story writing.

## Write your own story

Make up your own story using a toy and a block.
You could also put things in the way that the toy needs to avoid such as a pretend cave or a fierce animal.

# Teaching observations

Allowing students to make up their own story provides integrated learning in both creative writing and programming.
