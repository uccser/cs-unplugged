Today we are going to write our own unplugged fitness app. Before we start we need to design a programming language so that we know what to do.

## Lesson activities

1.  Brainstorm as a class all the different fitness exercises you could have in your programming language.

    {image file-path="img/topics/exercise-2.png" alt="Cartoon kids exercising" alignment="right"}

    Ideas to get you started include:

    -   Running on the spot
    -   Star jumps
    -   Ski jumps
    -   Catching bean bags

2.  Work in your groups and draw on each of the cards.
    You should design:

    -   A "GO" card to show the start of the program
    -   4 cards, each with a different exercise depicted on it
    -   A card that depicts how you should finish.
        Ideas could be:

        -   Strike a pose
        -   Sit with your arms crossed
        -   Stand as straight as you can

3.  Now place your cards in a row with the GO card first, then with each picture and how you should finish last.
    (There should be no numbers to indicate how many times you should do the exercise - that will come later.)

4.  Each group goes around and tries to work out what each of the cards mean from the other groups.

5.  Come together and discuss what was the same, and for which cards you had to “learn” because you weren’t sure what it was.

6.  This is the same with computer programming languages.
    You can learn to program with different languages, and some things seem similar in a new language, while other things you have to learn as it isn’t clear how to use a particular command.

7.  Now put out 6 whiteboards and the hula hoop like this:

    {image file-path="img/topics/whiteboards-and-hula-hoop.png" alt="6 whiteboards arranged around and in hula hoop"}

8.  Have one group put their Go card on the first whiteboard

    {image file-path="img/topics/whiteboards-and-hula-hoop-2.png" alt="6 whiteboards arranged around and in hula hoop"}

9.  Now have them put their exercises cards out on the whiteboards shown.
    Explain that whatever is in the hula hoop will be repeated (it's a loop!)

    {image file-path="img/topics/whiteboards-and-hula-hoop-3.png" alt="6 whiteboards arranged around and in hula hoop"}

10.  We need to set the parameters.
    A parameter tells us how long to do something or how many times to do something.
    Here we know to Go, To do star jumps (but not how many), to do ski jumps (but not how many), to catch a bean bag (but not how many) and that we should repeat the ski jumps and catch a bean bag, (but not how many times).

    {image file-path="img/topics/whiteboards-and-hula-hoop-4.png" alt="6 whiteboards arranged around and in hula hoop"}

11.  With your whiteboard pens, write in the number of times each exercise should be done.
    (Encourage the students to choose realistic numbers; the number on the hula hoop multiplies the ones inside.)
    For the exercises in the hula hoop, you need to repeat both of them how many times?
    (In the example, the sequence of 10 ski jumps and 5 catches is repeated 3 times, so it would be 10 ski, 5 catch, 10 ski, 5 catch, 10 ski, 5 catch).

12.  The last piece of programming is to show how we will end when we have finished our fitness app workout.

13.  Now we have built up our fitness app, it’s time to test it.
    The Programmer watches to see if everyone is doing it correctly.
    The Tester is looking for if there are any numbers to change or if the activities need further instructions. When the Tester says “Go” start following your fitness app.

14.  The Programmer asks the Tester if they saw anything they thought could be changed or improved.

## Applying what we have just learnt

Getting the sequence right for programming is very important.
If any detail is missing then your program won’t run how you expected it.
A loop in programming is when you repeat the instructions inside of it, until a certain condition is met (in this case each exercise is completed a certain number of times).
A loop can get a lot of instructions to happen with a relatively short program.

## Lesson reflection

-  Discuss all the areas where you needed to collaborate together.
What skills did you need to apply when discussing what should be programmed.  
-  Do you think this is a way you could set up fitness for your class?
-  Do you have ideas for writing different fitness programs this way?
