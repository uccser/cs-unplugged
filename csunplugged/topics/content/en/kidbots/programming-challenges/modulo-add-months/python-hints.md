-   Make variables called `original_month` and `months_to_add` and set their values to the inputs entered by the user.
    Make a variable called `new_month` and set its value to the sum of the `original_month` and `months_to_add` modulo 12.
-   Make a list called `months` and add the 12 months; January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December to your list (list of length 12).
    Hint: Remember in Python the first item of a list is found at index 0. In this case if you get the answer 0, you need to produce 'January'.
