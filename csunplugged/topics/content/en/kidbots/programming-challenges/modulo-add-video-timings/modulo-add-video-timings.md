# Add seconds, minutes and hours of two video clips

## Requirement:

Remix the program provided at [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/165770195/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/165770195/).
Write a program that takes the durations of two video clips as the input (asks the user to enter the number of hours, minutes and seconds) and displays the total duration as the output.
For example, for planning the length of clips in a film or songs in a playlist we might need to add the length of the first clip which is 32 minutes, 21 seconds (0:32:21) to the length of another clip which is 33 minutes and 20 seconds. Each time input (hours, minutes and seconds) are entered each on a different line.
The output of your program should be 1 hour, 5 minutes and 41 seconds.
