# Rotation of a triangle

## Requirement:

Write a program that draws a triangle, starting from point x:0, y:0, with its each 3 sides equal to 100 steps.
Your program must then draw triangles that are each rotated 15 degrees from the previous one, changing its colour every time it draws a new triangle.
