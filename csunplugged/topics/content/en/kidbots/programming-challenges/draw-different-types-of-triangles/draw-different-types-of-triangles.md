# Draw different types of triangles

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter an angle between 0 and 180 (not including 0 and 180), draws a triangle with two equal sides of length 100 steps (an isosceles triangle), starting from x:0, y:0, with the given angle between them.
It then displays a message saying if the triangle drawn is an acute, right or an obtuse triangle.
