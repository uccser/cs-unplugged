# Rotation of a circle

## Requirement:

Write a program that draws a circle, with the given centre point x:0, y:0, and its radius equal to 50 steps.
Your program must then draw circles that are each rotated 15 degrees from the previous one (forever), changing its colour every time it draws a new circle.
