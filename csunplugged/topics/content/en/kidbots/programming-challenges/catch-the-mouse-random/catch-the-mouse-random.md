# Catch the mouse (with random backdrops)

## Requirement:

Remix the program provided at [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/161489068/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/161489068/) and change its name to: **KidBots challenge 2.2 Catch the mouse (with random backdrops)**.

Give instructions to the “cat” to catch the “mouse” (avoiding the blue tiles) by altering the blocks under the `scratch:when I receive [go v]` block inside the “cat” sprite.
You may only use the following custom blocks:

-   `scratch:move_forward :: custom`
-   `scratch:move_right :: custom`
-   `scratch:move_left :: custom`

which are the custom blocks found under the "More Blocks" script.

-   When your instructions are complete, press the “Go” button.
-   To move the "cat" to the starting point (x: 200 y:-100), press the "Restart" button.
-   To change to a new background press the "Change background" button.
    Every time the "Change background" button is pressed, the program stamps blue tiles in 15 random locations inside the grid.
