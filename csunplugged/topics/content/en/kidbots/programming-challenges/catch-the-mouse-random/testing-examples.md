# Catch the mouse (with random backdrops)

## Testing examples:

Note that this version changes the backdrop every time you run the program; normally you would press the green button once, and then edit the program and press the "GO" button rather than starting the program again.

You will need to test that your program reaches the goal when you press the GO button.
