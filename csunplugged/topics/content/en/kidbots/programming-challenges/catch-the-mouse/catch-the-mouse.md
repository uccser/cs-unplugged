# Catch the mouse

## Requirement:

Remix the program provided at [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164749053/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164749053/) and change its name to: **KidBots challenge 2.1 Catch the mouse.**

Give instructions to the “cat” to catch the “mouse” (avoiding the blue tiles) by altering the blocks under the `scratch:when I receive [go v]` block inside the “cat” sprite.
You may only use the following custom blocks:

-   `scratch:move_forward() :: custom`
-   `scratch:turn_right :: custom`
-   `scratch:turn_left :: custom`

which are the custom blocks found under the "More Blocks" script.

-   When your instructions are complete, press the “Go” button.
-   To move the "cat" to the starting point (x: 200 y:-100), press the "Restart" button .
-   To change to a new background press the "Change background" button. We have provided 4 different backdrops for you to try out.
