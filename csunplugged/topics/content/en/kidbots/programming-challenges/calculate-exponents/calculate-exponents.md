# Calculate the exponents of numbers

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter 2 numbers (an integer for the base and a positive integer for the power) and calculates the results of the first number to the power of the second number.
You can assume that the power is 0 or more.

Note: The exponent of a number says how many times to use that number in a multiplication.
(e.g. 83 = 8 × 8 × 8 = 512 so the exponent 3 says to use the 8 three times in a multiplication.)
