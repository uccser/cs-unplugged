# Program a Bee-Bot

## Requirement:

Program your Bee-Bot (remix the program provided at [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/158364683/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/158364683/)) by giving instructions to the cat so the cat catches the mouse.

Pressing the four commands stores them in a list called "source code", and pressing the GO button will activate a script that goes through the list of commands and moves the cat according to each command.

The HOME button returns the cat to the starting position; the UNDO button removes the last command from the list; the PAUSE button pauses the cat for 5 seconds and the CLEAR button empties the list.
