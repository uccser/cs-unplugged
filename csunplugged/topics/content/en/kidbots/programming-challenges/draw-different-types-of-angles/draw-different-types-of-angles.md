# Draw different types of angles

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter an angle between 0 and 360 (not including 0 and 360) and displays a message saying if the angle is an acute, right, obtuse, straight or a reflex angle.
It then draws two lines of length 100 steps, starting from x:0, y:0, with the given angle between them.
