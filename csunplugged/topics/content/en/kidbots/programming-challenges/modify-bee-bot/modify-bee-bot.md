# Modify a Bee-Bot

## Requirement:

Remix the program provided at [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/158364683/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/158364683/) by changing the “pause” button to a “spin” button so pressing it adds the statement “spin” to the “source code” list.
When the statement is executed, it should spin the “cat” sprite 5 times (turning it 90 degrees to the right, 20 times).
