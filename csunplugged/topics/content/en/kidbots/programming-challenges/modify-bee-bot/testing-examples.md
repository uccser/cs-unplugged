# Modify a Bee-Bot

## Testing examples:

You will need to test your program by typing in your own commands to the simulated Bee-Bot to see if it behaves as intended.

To use the program, when the green flag is clicked, give instructions to the cat to catch the mouse by pressing the arrows for the Bee-Bot.
Press the “Go” button when you are ready.
