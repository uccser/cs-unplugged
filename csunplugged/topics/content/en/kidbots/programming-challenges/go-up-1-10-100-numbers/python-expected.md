For the upper bound `73` the code could output:
```text
I'll generate a number between 1 and a number you enter.
Enter number as the upper range:
What is 10 numbers after 43?
```
Note that it could ask for 1, 10, or 100 numbers after, and the number it picks only has to be in the range given, but can be anything in that range.

Continuing with this example...
For the input `53` the code will output:
```text
Well done!
```
For the input `47` (or any other incorrect answer) the code will output:
```text
Nice try! The right answer is: 53
```
