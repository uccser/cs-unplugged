# Draw a circle with radius 100

## Requirement:

Write a program that draws a circle, with the given centre point x:0, y:0, and its radius equal to 100 steps.
You can use the same method as the "Draw a 360-sided polygon" challenge, but this time you will need to work out how long each side is based on the circumference of the circle, and you'll need to work out the circumference from the radius.
