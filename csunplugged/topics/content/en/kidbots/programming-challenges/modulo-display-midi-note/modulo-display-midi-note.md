# Display MIDI note names

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to type in a number between 0 and 127 (60 is middle C) as the input and displays the corresponding MIDI note name as well as playing the note (the midi value mod 12 will be 0 to 11 for C, C#, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, Bb, B - and these can be looked up in a list).
