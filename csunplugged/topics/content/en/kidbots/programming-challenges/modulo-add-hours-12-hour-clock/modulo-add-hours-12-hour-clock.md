# Add hours on a clock (12-hour clock)

## Requirement:

Write a program that adds hours on a clock; for example, on a 12-hour clock, 11 o'clock plus 3 hours is 2 o'clock.
This can be done using the modulo operator, except you need to adjust the output so that 0 in mod 12 is displayed as 12.
See [challenge "Add hours on a clock (24-hour clock)"]('topics:programming_challenge' 'unplugged-programming' 'modulo-add-hours-24-hour-clock') if a 24-hour clock is usual in your country.
