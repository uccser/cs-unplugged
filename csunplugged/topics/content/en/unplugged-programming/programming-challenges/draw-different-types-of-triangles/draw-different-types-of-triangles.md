# Draw different types of triangles

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter an angle between 0 and 180 (not including 0 and 180), draws a triangle with two equal sides of length 100 steps (an isosceles triangle), starting from x:0, y:0, with the given angle between them.
It then displays a message saying if the triangle drawn is an acute, right or an obtuse triangle.  

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided:

| Input      | Output                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 45         | This is an acute triangle.                 |
| 90         | This is a right triangle.                  |
| 120        | This is an obtuse triangle.                |

Click on the green flag, enter the inputs provided in the “testing examples” to see the expected output of your program.
