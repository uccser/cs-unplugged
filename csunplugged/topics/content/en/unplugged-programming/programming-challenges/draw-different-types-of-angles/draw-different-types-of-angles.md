# Draw different types of angles

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter an angle between 0 and 360 (not including 0 and 360) and displays a message saying if the angle is an acute, right, obtuse, straight or a reflex angle.
It then draws two lines of length 100 steps, starting from x:0, y:0, with the given angle between them.

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided:

| Input      | Output                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 0          | The angle you entered is an acute angle.   |
| 45         | The angle you entered is an acute angle.   |
| 90         | The angle you entered is a right angle.    |
| 110        | The angle you entered is an obtuse angle.  |
| 180        | The angle you entered is a straight angle. |
| 240        | The angle you entered is a reflex angle.   |
