There will be a few ways to do this. Below are hints for three different ways you can program this.

-  **Solution 1:**
   By drawing a hexagon inside a star (see “Geometry challenge 7.2”).

-  **Solution 2:** By drawing 6 triangles;

   1. draw a triangle,
   2. move back to the last vertex drawn,
   3. turn 60 degrees (as if you are drawing a hexagon)
   4. repeat steps 1-3 6 times).

-  **Solution 3:** By drawing 2 triangles.
