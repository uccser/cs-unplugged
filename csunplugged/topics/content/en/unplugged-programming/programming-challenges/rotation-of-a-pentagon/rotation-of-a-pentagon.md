# Rotation of a pentagon

## Requirement:

Write a program that draws a pentagon, starting from point x:0, y:0, with its sides equal to 100 steps.
Your program must then draw pentagons that are each rotated 15 degrees from the previous one (forever), changing its colour every time it draws a new pentagon.
