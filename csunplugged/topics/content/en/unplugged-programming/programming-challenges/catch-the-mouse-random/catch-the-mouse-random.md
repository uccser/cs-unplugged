# Catch the Mouse (with random backdrops)

## Requirement:

Remix the program provided at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/161489068/ and change its name to: **KidBots challenge 2.2 Catch the mouse (with random backdrops)**.

Give instructions to the “cat” to catch the “mouse” (avoiding the blue tiles) by altering the blocks under the `scratch:when I recieve [go v]` block inside the “cat” sprite. You may only use the following custom blocks:

  -   `scratch:move_forward`
  -   `scratch:move_right`
  -   `scratch:move_left`

which are the custom blocks found under the "More Blocks" script.

  -   When your instructions are complete, press the “Go” button.
  -   To move the "cat" to the starting point (x: 200 y:-100), press the "Restart" button .
  -   To change to a new background press the "Change background" button. Every time the "Change background" button is pressed, the program stamps blue tiles in 15 random locations inside the grid.


## Testing examples:

Note that this version changes the backdrop every time you run the program; normally you would press the green button once, and then edit the program and press the "GO" button rather than starting the program again.

You will need to test that your program reaches the goal when you press the GO button.
