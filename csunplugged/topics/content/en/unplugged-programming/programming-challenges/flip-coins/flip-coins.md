# Flip a coin (probability of getting a head or a tail)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user for a number of coin flips. It then flips the coin that many times and reports the percentages of heads and tails as the output.

## Testing examples:

Your program may have different outputs from the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided (as the head and tail flips are generated randomly and may differ every time your program is executed).
  
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>70% heads<br>30% tails</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1000</td>
    <td>52% heads<br>48% tails</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1000000</td>
    <td>50% heads<br>50% tails</td>
  </tr>
</table>
 
Click on the green flag, enter the inputs provided in the “testing examples” to see the expected output of your program.
