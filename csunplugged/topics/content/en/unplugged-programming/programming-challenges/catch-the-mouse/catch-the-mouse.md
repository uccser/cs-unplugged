# Catch the Mouse

## Requirement:

Remix the program provided at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164749053/ and change its name to: **KidBots challenge 2.1 Catch the mouse.**

Give instructions to the “cat” to catch the “mouse” (avoiding the blue tiles) by altering the blocks under the `scratch:when I receive [go v]` block inside the “cat” sprite. You may only use the following custom blocks:

  -   `scratch:move_forward()`
  -   `scratch:turn_right`
  -   `scratch:turn_left`

which are the custom blocks found under the "More Blocks" script.

  -   When your instructions are complete, press the “Go” button.
  -   To move the "cat" to the starting point (x: 200 y:-100), press the "Restart" button .
  -   To change to a new background press the "Change background" button. We have provided 4 different backdrops for you to try out.

## Testing examples:

You will need to add the correct set of blocks under the `scratch:when I receive [go v]` block so the cat can catch the mouse.

Click on the green flag and press the “Go” button to see the expected output of your program when the correct set of instructions are provided.
