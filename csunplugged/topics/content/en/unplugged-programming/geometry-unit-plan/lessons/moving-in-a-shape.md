# Moving in a shape

## Key questions

How could thinking about programming help us to understand the features of a shape?
Why is it important to get the sequence right when drawing a shape? 

## Lesson starter

{panel type="general" title="Notes on resources"}

For the squared grid, this works on painted chess boards, snakes and ladders, or can be marked on the pavement/floor with chalk/tape.
If there isn't space for a large grid, the activity could be done on a small board, such as a chess board, the blank side of 100s boards, or a printed grid.

{image file-path="img/topics/grid.png" caption="This example is a starter lesson where the girl on the white grid is “The Bot”, the girl at the back is “The Programmer” and the boy in the green and gold is the Tester." alt="Kids standing on and around a grid"}

Ideally this lesson should take place around a large grid such as: 

-   An outside painted chess board.
-   If you have grids in your classroom carpet
-   Making masking tape grids one the floor in your classroom
-   Draw a chalk grid either in your classroom or outside

Ask for two volunteers and give yourself and them the roles of:

**Role 1:** The Developer (who writes the program) - Teacher’s role to model

**Role 2:** The Tester (who instructs the bot and looks for bugs)

**Role 3:** The Bot (who runs the program)

We’re going to write our own program that makes the Bot move in the shape of a square.

Program Arnold the Parrot (the Bot) to move in the shape of a square that is 3 squares by 3 squares.
He can only move one square at a time; the forward command moves them to the square they are facing, and left and right makes them turn 90 degrees on the square that they are standing on.

How would we write the instructions using our whiteboards to make these moves?

Forward               Right               Left

Ideas for this include using arrows; abbreviations (like F, R and L), writing in a different language, using symbols from other cultures, and writing in Braille. 

{panel end}

## Lesson activities

1.  Work in groups of three, one person is the Bot, another is the Tester and last person is the Programmer.

2.  Agree on what will be written down on the whiteboard to be the programming language for move forward, move left, and move right.

3.  Find a toy from around the classroom.

4.  Together choose between moving your toy in a square or a rectangle. 

5.  The Programmer writes down on a whiteboard what the “program” is  to get the toy to follow the right path (in the shape of the square or rectangle). 

6.  The Tester then takes the whiteboard and a different coloured whiteboard pen.
    The Tester tells the Bot each instruction in the program.
    The Tester puts a tick next to the code that is correct and underlines any code that causes problems (such as running off the board or into an object, or running out of instructions before reaching the goal).
    If this happens the Tester says “Stop” and the Bot stops and goes back to the start.
    The Tester gives the whiteboard to the Programmer, who then debugs the code and gives the Tester a revised version.
    The "bug" might be earlier than where the Tester noted that things went wrong!

    {panel type="teaching" title="Teaching observations"}

    The Tester need not necessarily communicate using the words "Forward", "Left" and "Right".
    For example, the could use another language, including sign language, or use other gestures to communicate each action to the Bot.
    To write the program you could have cards with these written on so students don’t have to remember all the new learning.
    This is a great opportunity to use words from an unfamiliar language; there are only three words that will be used over and over (although you could also introduce phrases like "your turn", 'well done" and so on), so it is a good chance to learn by repetition of the new words.

    {panel end}

7.  Repeat step 6 until the program is free of bugs and works as intended.
 
8.  Change roles and move the Bot and choose a new shape to trace until everyone has had a turn.
 
## Other challenges

Are there other ways we could have programmed the “Bot” to draw the square? Discuss the programming options and test each one. Possible answers could include doing the square backwards, or going over a line more than once.

Students can also be challenged to mark out other simple geometric shapes.

## Applying what we have just learnt

It’s quite common to think that programming is some kind of special talent that people either have or don’t have, but this isn't so!
Like all skills, programming is something you learn through practise, making mistakes, and learning from them.
An important skill that programmers need is to be able to communicate with others, especially when they are working out what the program should do; they also need to be persistent when finding and fixing bugs.
Bugs happen all the time in programming, so being able to identify where the bug occurs and problem solving how to fix it is incredibly important.
It doesn’t matter how experienced you are at programming, there will always be bugs that need to be found, and fixed.
That’s why the word “debugging” is so important to programmers.

## 2D programming challenges

Simple robotic toys like the "Bee-Bot" have a very similar set of commands, and can be used to follow up.

## Lesson reflection

Who are the students who can visualise what needs to be programmed?
