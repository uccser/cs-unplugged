# Draw a 360 sided polygon

## Requirement:

Write a program that draws a 360-gon, a polygon with 360 sides of length 1 step, turing one degree at each point. Note: The sides are so small that this will look like a circle, but a 360 sided polygon is geometrically different from a circle (i.e. circle has infinite number of sides). Still, in the following challenges we will call it a circle.
