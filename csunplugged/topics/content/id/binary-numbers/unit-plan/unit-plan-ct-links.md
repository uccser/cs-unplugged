# Algorithmic thinking

There are several important algorithms for students to learn and follow in this unit. These algorithms are solutions to the problems “How do we convert between decimal and binary numbers?”, “How do we represent letters using binary numbers?”, and “How do we convert a message written in a binary code back to letters?”. Students will be tasked with following these algorithms accurately, articulating them, and explaining them.

# Abstraction

Binary number representation is an abstraction that hides the complexity of the electronics and hardware inside a computer that store data. Abstraction helps us simplify things because we can ignore the details we don’t currently need to know.

{panel type="ct-decomposition"}

# Decomposition

An example of decomposition is breaking the conversion of the number to binary into one bit at a time. The questions "Should this be 1 or 0" for each of the dot cards is decomposing the problem to a series of questions.

# Generalising and patterns

Recognising patterns in the way the binary number system works helps give us a deeper understanding of the concepts involved, and assists us in generalising these concepts and patterns so that we can apply them to other problems.

{panel type="ct-logic"}

# Logic

Logical thinking means using rules you already know and using logic to deduce more rules and information from these. Once we know what number each of the binary cards represents then we can use this knowledge to figure out how to represent other numbers with the cards. If you memorise how to represent the numbers we can make with 5 cards, does that mean you understand how to represent any number with any number of bits? It doesn’t, but you can understand how to do that if you understand the logic behind how these numbers with the 5 cards are made.

{panel type="ct-evaluation"}

# Evaluation

An example of evaluation is working out how many different values can be represented by a given number of bits (e.g. 5 bits can represent 32 different values), and vice versa (to represent 1000 different values, you need at least 10 bits).
