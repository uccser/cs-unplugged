# Count dots on 5 black and white cards as one input (without a loop)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the end user to enter 5 black and white cards representing bits, all as one line of input ('B' for black and 'W' for white), and displays the total number of dots as the output. You can do this without a loop, using 5 similar sets of blocks to process each of the 5 values.
