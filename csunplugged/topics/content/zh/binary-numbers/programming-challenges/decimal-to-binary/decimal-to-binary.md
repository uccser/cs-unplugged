# Convert a positive decimal number to a binary number

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the user to enter any decimal number as the input and displays the binary cards representing that number using '1' for dots showing and '0' for not showing as the output (this converts the decimal number to binary). Do this by working out the largest bit value needed, and then working down through smaller bit values.
