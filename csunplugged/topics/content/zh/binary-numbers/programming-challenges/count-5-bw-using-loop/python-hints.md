- Make a variable called `total_number_of_dots` and set its value to 0.
- Make another variable called `number_of_dots` and set its value to 16.
- Add the value of `number_of_dots` to the value of `total_number_of_dots` every time the end user enters ‘W’ as the input. Repeat this 5 times dividing the value of `number_of_dots` by 2 each time and convert the result to an integer using int().
- Display the `total_number_of_dots` as the output.
- Use a for loop to repeat this five times
