# Information Theory

Computers are all about information, but what is information, and how can we measure it?
Is there more information if I give you a sheet of paper with the word "blah" repeated a thousand times, or if the paper has a recipe for a delicious meal?
This activity uses a game that is actually an experiment to measure information content of text; the ideas that came from this experiment at the time of the birth of computing led to many key ideas that underpin how modern digital devices can store and exchange information efficiently.
