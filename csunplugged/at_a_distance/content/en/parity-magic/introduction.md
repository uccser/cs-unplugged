# Parity Magic

This activity involves a 'magic trick' that makes the audience think you have an amazing memory, while at the same time revealing an idea that is used to protect the data we use on digital devices.
The data stored on a computer and transmitted on the internet uses very vulnerable media - tiny magnetised particles on magnetic disks, small charges of electricity, and rapid pulses of light, so it is very easy for some of the data to change unintentionally, perhaps because of electrical interference or imperfections in the way a device has been made.
Error control is a clever idea that enables computers to put data back to how it was before it was messed up, usually without the person using the system even knowing that it has happened.

## Facilitator preparation

- If you arenâ€™t familiar with this unplugged activity, you can review the in-person version in the [Error detection and correction topic]('topics:topic' 'error-detection-and-correction').
