# Product Code Check Digits

The product code on most consumer items is used to quickly scan a product at a point of sale.
It's important that this happens accurately, since customers will be unhappy if they discover they are being charged for the wrong items.
There's a simple trick built into every product code that supports them working so well; it uses simple arithmetic to check the numbers, and this activity shows how it can be accessed in a way that reveals an important idea from computer science that is right under our noses!

## Facilitation preparation

For each slide we’ve written a suggested script, facilitation notes and preparation reminders for you.
These have been written with the assumption that you are familiar with [the original lesson]('topics:lesson' 'error-detection-and-correction' 'product-code-check-digits').

- It is useful for the participants to notice how many different places they see product codes (barcodes, not QR codes) being scanned (shops, books, loyalty cards, movie tickets, package delivery service, etc).
- Have participants bring an item with a barcode on it to the session if possible.
- Find your own product codes on a variety of products to use during the session.
  You will need at least one to demonstrate with but it is good to have a couple of different ones also to give other examples to the audience.

If you are going to use the modulo 10 functionality then familiarise yourself on how to [teach modulo 10]('topics:lesson' 'kidbots' 'modulo').
It’s actually easier to complete knowing how to add using modulo 10 - and it’s fun!
