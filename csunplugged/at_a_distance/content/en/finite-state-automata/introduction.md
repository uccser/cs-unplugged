# Finite State Automata

Description to be added.

## Facilitator preparation

- Prepare the lessons and trial them with the video conference software that you are going to present with.
- If you aren’t familiar with this activity there is a written description in the classic section of the CS Unplugged website called [Finite State Automata - Treasure Hunt](https://classic.csunplugged.org/activities/finite-state-automata/), and you can see it in action in the [Treasure Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kagtp2gWhU) video (this version is based on a commuting service run by pirates!).
  A slightly different version based on a commuter train service is in the “Formal Languages” chapter of the Computer Science Field Guide, which is aimed at high school students; you can find it in the section on [finite state automata](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/formal-languages/finite-state-automata/).
- The interactive web page that we use for distance teaching is from here: [Computer Science Field Guide Trainsylvania interactive](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/trainsylvania/).
