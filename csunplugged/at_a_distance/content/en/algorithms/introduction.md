# Algorithms

The term "algorithm" comes up a lot these days - they are fundamental to how we write programs for computers.
But what is an algorithm?
They can be hard to define in a satisfying way, so in this activity we will learn by doing - students get to solve a simple problem, and then use that experience to articulate what the algorithm is that they used, and in turn, distinguish an algorithm from a computer program.

## Facilitator preparation

If you arenâ€™t familiar with this activity, review the following here:

- [Watch the video on the introduction page](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/algorithms/) of the CS Field Guide for an overview of what an algorithm is.
- Read the first 5 paragraphs and have a trial run of the High Score boxes interactive in [CS Field Guide: Algorithms, programs and informal instructions](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/algorithms/whats-the-big-picture/#algorithms-programs-and-informal-instructions).

### Preparation and teaching resources:

- Read through the [guide on how to deliver CS Unplugged at a distance content]('at_a_distance:delivery-guide').
- Prepare the lesson and practice it in the video conference software that you are going to present with.

### Resources:

- Paper and pen to record first number revealed.
