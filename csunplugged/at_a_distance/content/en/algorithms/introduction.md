# Algorithms

The term "algorithm" comes up a lot these days - they are fundamental to how we write programs for computers.
But what is an algorithm?
They can be hard to define in a satisfying way, so in this activity we will learn by doing - students get to solve a simple problem, and then use that experience to articulate what the algorithm is that they used, and in turn, distinguish an algorithm from a computer program.

## Facilitator preparation

- Read through the [guide on how to deliver CS Unplugged at a distance content]('at_a_distance:delivery-guide').
- Go through the slides and trial them with the video conference software that you are going to present with.
- If you arenâ€™t familiar with the original unplugged activity, review the [in-person version of the lesson]('topics:lesson' '' '').
- [Watch the video on the introduction page](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/algorithms/) of the Computer Science Field Guide for an overview of what an algorithm is.
- Read the first 5 paragraphs and have a trial run of the High Score boxes interactive in [Computer Science Field Guide: Algorithms, programs and informal instructions](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/algorithms/whats-the-big-picture/#algorithms-programs-and-informal-instructions).
