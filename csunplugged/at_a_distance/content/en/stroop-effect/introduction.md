# The Stroop Effect

Description to be added.

## Facilitator preparation

- If you aren’t familiar with this unplugged activity, you can review the in-person version in Section 9.1 of the [EdX MOOC: Teaching Computational Thinking](https://www.edx.org/course/teaching-computational-thinking).
- Create your coloured word list in your participants’ first language (if you use English and it’s not their first language, it can be easier to say the colours, and the point is to make it confusing!)
