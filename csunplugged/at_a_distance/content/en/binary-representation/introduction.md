# Binary Representation

Description to be added.

## Facilitator preparation

- If you aren’t familiar with this unplugged activity, review the [in-person version of the lessons]('topics:topic' 'binary-numbers').
- Work out your birth month, or a month you want to use, in binary i.e. ‘no, yes, no, yes, no’ for October.
- Optional: Ask participants to make a set of binary cards as a task prior to the session, so they can experience binary cards first hand.
- Optional: Instead of using the interactive binary cards, you could use a document reader to demonstrate binary representation.
  Using a document camera is closer to the way that it would be done physically in a classroom; if you use the online interactive, you should emphasise that in practice it’s good to have a set of cards, and at least hold up a set to your camera to show what the online version is simulating.
