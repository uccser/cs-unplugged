    <h3>Values Category</h3>
    <p>
        The Values category is one major difference between the new Block-based system and Scratch that will immediately stand out to Scratch users.
        This category contains the 'Number', 'String', and 'Boolean' blocks, which relate to the four major data types in programming, i.e., integer/float, string, and boolean.
        In Scratch, the blocks contain blank fields where users can type their input in. However, in the block-based system, users are forced to specify what type their input is by using one of the three data type blocks.
    </p>

    <h3>Ask and Wait for Number/Text</h3>
    <p>
        The 'Ask and Wait' block is a popular block in Scratch and is used to get user-specified input when the program is executed.
        However, this block does not really specify the type of input the user has entered.
        Therefore, we created the 'Ask and Wait for Text' and 'Ask and Wait for Number' blocks to, furthermore, enforce users to specify the data type their program is expecting.
        This further bridges the gap between block-based and text-based programming and will help ease this transition.
    </p>

    <h3>Running your program</h3>
    <p>
        Scratch users are familiar with clicking the green flag or using the 'When green flag is clicked' block to start their program.
        However, this new system does not use this feature. Instead, it simply has a Run button located at the bottom of the screen to start their program immediately.
        This Run button has been designed to have the same colour as Scratch's green flag to passively inform users that this is how to run their program.
        Clicking this Run button will execute their program, but it won't submit it to the testing server, giving them the ability to debug their program.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying the output</h3>
    <p>
        Finally, the new block-based system displays the output differently from Scratch.
        It uses a Console box (located underneath the Results Table), labelled "Run Output", to display the output of users' programs.
        The colours of the output in the Console box change depending on the type of the output (e.g., green for integer/float, black for string, and purple for boolean).
