            <li>
                Do software designers use psychology concepts when designing their applications?

                Have you ever used an application, or website, and had to think carefully about what to click?
                Share in the chat if you can think of an example when you had to think carefully about what to click.

            <h4>Facilitation notes:</h4>
            <p>
                Wait until a couple of suitable comments have been made in the chat and comment appropriately on them.
                As a prompt about thinking carefully, you might ask if they've had a dialogue box that says “yes”, “no” and “cancel”, and they've had to think hard about whether they want “no” or “cancel”; or if they've been in a situation where they are worried pressing the wrong button will cause major problems.
                For thinking about whether software designers use psychology, they might think about whether some apps/software seems very easy to use, and others are very confusing.
                Is this by accident, or has some thought gone into them?
