        <ul>
            <li>
                Have you ever used an application and had to think carefully about what to click?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do software designers use psychology concepts when designing their applications?
            </li>
        </ul>

                Have you ever used an application, or website, and had to think carefully about what to click?
                Share in the chat if you can think of an example when you had to think carefully about what to click.
            {% include "at_a_distance/components/speech-bubble-close.html" %}

            <p>
                Wait until a couple of suitable comments have been made in the chat and comment appropriately on them.
                As a prompt about thinking carefully, you might ask if they've had a dialogue box that says “yes”, “no” and “cancel”, and they've had to think hard about whether they want “no” or “cancel”; or if they've been in a situation where they are worried pressing the wrong button will cause major problems.
                For thinking about whether software designers use psychology, they might think about whether some apps/software seems very easy to use, and others are very confusing.
                Is this by accident, or has some thought gone into them?

                We are going to go through the next few slides quickly.
                As each one comes up, say the <strong>colour</strong> you see and not the word.
                You will be kept on mute, so you can say it to yourself.
                Here we go...

                    Now we've had the warm up, let's try timing this activity.
                    I have two lists and we will time how long it takes to read each of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These next two activities are the same as our practice round, but with all the words on one page.
                    Say the colour the word is printed in, rather than the word.
                    The slide will also show a timer; when you have read all of the words out loud, look at the timer at the bottom and note what time it is on when you finish.
                    Are you ready?
                    Here's the list for you to read...
                </p>
            {% include "at_a_distance/components/speech-bubble-close.html" %}

            <p>
                Count down from 5 seconds, then move to the next slide and say “Go!”.

                Now type how long it took into the chat. It's not a test of how clever you are - it's more a test of how silly the exercise is!

                From the chat it looks like you've all had a go.
                The range of times seems to be [estimate the time range], so let's make the average time for this to be [say a time that would be close to the average; it will typically be around 10 to 14 seconds, and your estimate doesn't have to be very accurate].

                We'll repeat the activity with the next slide.
                This time the words will be “congruent” with the colours - the colour will be the same as the word.
                Let's see how long this one takes!

                    Let's compare the times; what do you notice?
                    What would be the ratio?
                    [Typically the congruent list is 2 to 3 times faster to read.]

                    Share in the chat if you've felt like this using a digital system, where the interface (what it has displayed to you) is confusing to use.

                    Has a bad interface ever slowed you down or made you feel frustrated or even anxious?

                <p>
                    This activity is called the 'Stroop effect' and is a famous experiment from psychology named after John Ridley Stroop.
                    The Stroop test measures the amount of time it takes to say the name of the printed colours in an incongruent (incompatible, non-matching) list and compares this time to saying the name of the print colour in a congruent (agreeing, matching) list.
                    Stroop found that people were often 2 or 3 times slower trying to read incongruent information.

                    Let's see it how this applies to Human Computer Interaction.
