This way of thinking about answering questions has led to a way of understanding how all data is represented on computers using the binary number system.
If you do the "binary challenge" activity, youâ€™ll experience the same thinking in a different way.
The way we have done it here relates to the area of computer science called "information theory", where we think about how to represent data using just two different values.
When we represent data, we often represent "yes" and "no" as the digits 1 and 0; in fact, the use of these two digits is the reason we call our devices "digital".
The idea that you can communicate numbers and words by just saying yes and no is closely related to the idea that we can represent any data using combinations of just two different digits.
