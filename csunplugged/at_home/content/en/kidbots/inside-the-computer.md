A key point in this activity is that the instructions are all written before they are tested.
We don't allow anyone to give additional instructions to the Bot; they must follow exactly what is written (which can sometimes be humorous if they head off in the wrong direction.)
This is what happens when programming: you write instructions for a program, and when you run the program, they are all executed without the programmer intervening.
A programmer needs to picture in their mind what would happen when they are writing the instructions; during testing they will find out if what they pictured was correct!

Creating a sequence of instructions a computer or robot can follow is an important skill in programming.
Like all skills, programming is something you learn through practice, making mistakes, and learning from them.
Another important skill that programmers need is to be able to communicate with others, especially when they are working out what the program should do.
They also need to be persistent when finding and fixing bugs.
Bugs happen all the time in programming, so being able to identify where the bug occurs and problem solving how to fix it is incredibly important.
It doesn’t matter how experienced you are at programming, there will always be bugs that need to be found, and fixed.
That’s why being prepared, and able, to debug is so important.
