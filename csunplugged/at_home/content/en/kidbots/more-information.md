- Often we do this with a third helper, a “tester”, who reads out the instructions to the bot, but in the home version the bot themselves can test the instructions.

- [Here’s](https://csunplugged.org/en/topics/kidbots/unit-plan/rescue-mission/) a version where the challenge is given as a Rescue Mission.
- There are online versions that can be used to explore and extend this kind of programming; for example, [Lightbot](https://lightbot.com/), [ScratchJr](https://www.scratchjr.org/) and Bee-Bot for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tts.beebot&hl=en) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bee-bot/id500131639).
