Tip: If your child finds it hard to visualise how the arrows work, place the arrows within the grid to show what the bot will do. It’s also a great technique to write the first few instructions of the code, test it and then add to it (consider placing a toy on the grid to remind them where their initial instructions got the bot to). If you are putting arrows on the grid, the turning arrows will also need a forward arrow in the same box, or you can put the forward arrows on the line between boxes, which makes it clearer what it does.

There are many ways to extend this challenge. You can add in obstacles that must be avoided. It is also instructive to reduce the possible instructions to only “Forward” and “Turn left”. With some thought, it’s still possible to get to any position on the grid without the “Turn right” instruction!
