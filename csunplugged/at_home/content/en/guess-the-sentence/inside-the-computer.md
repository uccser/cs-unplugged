This kind of experiment is used by computer scientists to measure the amount of "information" in a document.
Being able to have a good guess at what is coming next is the basis of working out how to reduce the amount of data used for sending text, photos and videos (this is called compression, and is the underlying theory behind showing videos over the internet and storing lots of photos or songs on a mobile phone.

If you had a 400 page book containing the phrase "blah, blah, blah" over and over, how easy would the letters be to guess using this game? (Probably very easy - there’s not much information there).
What about a 400-page instruction manual for flying a plane? (Probably hard to guess a lot of words - it has a lot of information).

Explain that computer scientists measure information by how surprising a message (or book!) is.
Telling you something that you know already — for example, when a friend who always walks to school says "I walked to school today" — doesn’t give you any information, because it isn’t surprising.
If your friend said instead, "I got a ride to school in a helicopter today," that would be surprising, and would therefore tell us a lot of information.
The number of yes/no guesses indicates how much information there is in the text.

This kind of prediction is also used for auto-completing text while you are typing.
The computer is guessing what is most likely to come next (based on what people usually type).
