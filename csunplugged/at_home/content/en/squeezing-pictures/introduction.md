# Squeezing pictures into codes

## What you need

- A pencil (ideally 2B or heavier), or a dark pen, felt-tip marker or dark crayon. A pencil is easier in case you want to erase mistakes.
- Paper with a grid on it - squares should be about 2mm to 5mm (about 1/8 to 1/4 inches); the grid squares should be easy to colour in for the type of pencil or pen you are using. A grid of 20 by 20 squares will be enough for the examples below; a larger one will be needed for the challenges. Options include:
    - Printing from the PDF pages here 
        - [Large grid](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Dvvq3E3RbkUSAefR5up6HxmF2_7Mxs6/view?usp=sharing)
        - [Small grids](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zSNFNfHghXmx4gs_HCXqswNGbdNGQ4kc/view?usp=sharing ) (6 on one page) - these require more precision
    - Use “quad paper” or “graph paper”
    - Draw your own grid using a ruler and pencil
- Print or write out the codes for “Picture 1” from [this page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1spplSbaSrYlD_9JiC_PDOwgwAU1X5hkN/view?usp=sharing) (it has codes for 4 different pictures on it) 

## Skills needed

- Reading numbers and counting up to about 20, colouring grid squares

## Key question

- If pictures are made of millions of pixels (mega-pixels), how can they be represented efficiently?
