- There’s an online run-length activity [here](https://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/run-length-encoding/) where you can draw your own image, or put in your own codes and see them decoded.
- You can find more information on how compression works [here](https://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/coding-compression/).
- Often run length coding will include the white pixels at the end of a line as an extra number; by doing this all the numbers can be written as one long list.
  This means that as long as you know the width of the image, the code doesn’t have to be broken up into lines, and so it’s just a whole lot of numbers, which are very easy to represent on a computer.
