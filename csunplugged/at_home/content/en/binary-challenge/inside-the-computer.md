It’s usually cheaper and faster to build computers that only use two symbols (the "yes" and "no" we’ve been using, or sometimes they are written as 1 and 0).
Modern digital systems use this binary representation, and the numbers in turn can be used to represent all sorts of things - text, pictures, videos and more.
All these things are represented with combinations of the two digits, which is why we call them digital devices!
The power and limitations of representing things using just "yes" and "no" dictate the power and limitations of the data that computers can store and send over networks, so understanding how they work is a gateway to understanding digital data.

By the way, the short word for the binary digits you've been working with is "bit" - the cards represent 5 bits.
Many things about computers are measured in bits: download speeds are in bits per second (in fact, usually millions of bits per second), computers can be 16-bit or 32-bit based on how many bits they process at a time, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that represents money securely as bits, the quality of music and video is often chosen by their bit rate, the strength of a secure connection to your bank is measure by the number of bits in its cryptographic key, and so on.
A bit is so simple that you can make one out of cardboard, and so powerful that nearly all our trading and communication is based on transferring bits.
