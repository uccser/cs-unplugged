    question: The following grid has two cards flipped. You can’t be sure which two they are, but you can narrow it down to 4 that might be wrong. Type in which 4 they are - give your answers separated by commas, but no space, and increasing order e.g. A3 comes before B2, and A2 comes before A3, so the answer might look like “A3,B2,B5,C2”.
    answer: "B4,B6,E4,E6"
