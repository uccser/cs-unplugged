In this activity each of these cards represents one bit (binary digit).
All data on computers is stored using bits, and if one of them changes accidentally because of something like interference on a network or small failures on a disk drive, the computer needs to detect that this has happened, and ideally put it right again.

In this trick, flipping a card simulates a bit being changed, which causes an error in the data.
The addition of the extra cards (or bits) before the data is stored or sent over a network is a technique that enables it to be checked, and the computer can fix the errors without us even knowing a problem occurred.

This method of detecting and correcting errors is called “parity”; parity just means “odd or even” numbers; in our trick, an even number in each row and column means things are ok, and an odd number means that things are, well, odd.
