Developer Philosophy
##############################################################################

We follow the following philosophy for developing the CS Unplugged project:

  We aim to create software that enables authors to easily create, modify,
  and share education material for the CS Unplugged project.

In short: *Think of the author*.

This page explains design decisions we made throughout developing the CS
Unplugged system.

Configuration Files
==============================================================================

We use `YAML`_ for storing configuration data of content.
It has improved human readability over JSON and XML, especially for authors
who have no or little experience with configuration files.

We try to avoid deep nesting (indentation) within configuration files as it's
harder for authors to read nested data.
We have split configuration data across multiple configuration files to avoid
this issue.

Writing Content
==============================================================================

We chose Markdown as the language for text content as it has a great balance
between simplicity of writing for authors, and clear structure when converting
to HTML.
