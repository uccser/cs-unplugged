Writing Philosophy
##############################################################################

This page covers the philosophy of writing material for CS Unplugged.

Most of the philosophy of what we mean by the "Unplugged" approach is on our website (On the 'About' page under 'Principles').
 
In terms of how we present material, Unplugged activities are formatted as Lesson plans that have enough detail for a classroom to use, including links to computational thinking. If you have an idea for an activity, but it's not quite fleshed out enough as a lesson plan, it can be contributed as a PDF file to the Community section, which is an area where we collect great ideas that can inspire teachers and lesson plan authors.
