Repository Directory
=================================================

The repository directory (or root directory) contains the following:

- ``csunplugged/``

  - This directory contains the Django web system for the CS Unplugged website.
    This includes all raw text content, images, resources, etc.

- ``docs/``

  - This directory contains the documentation for the repository (which includes
    the file you are reading now).

- ``subtitles/``

  - This directory contains subtitle files for CS Unplugged videos.

- ``README.md``

  - This file contains an introduction and important information for the
    repository.

- ``LICENCE.md``

  - This file details the licences the repository uses.

- Plus other files used for installation and repository configuration.

csunplugged Directory
=================================================

The ``csunplugged/`` directory holds the Django web system and is split across
the following directories:

- ``config/``

  - This directory holds the settings used by the Django system.
    It's unlikely you'll edit the contents of this directory unless you are
    changing the Django configuration (for example: adding a new application).

.. _django-applications:

Django contains 'applications' which are Python packages that provide
some set of features.
Each large part/chunk of the CS Unplugged is a separate application.
The project currently contains the following applications:

- ``general/``

  - This applicate displays webpages for generic pages on the website.
    For example: homepage, about page, contact page, etc.

- ``topics/``

  - The core CS Unplugged content is split across topics, with each topic
    containing any combination of unit plans, lessons, follow up activities,
    programming challenges (plugged in activities), and much more.
    This application stores and displays the topics content.

- ``resources/``

  - The CS Unplugged project contains custom printable resources that can
    contain randomly generated components and translations.
    This application stores, generates, and displays these resources.

Details on how to modify an application can be found within their relavent
author and developer documentation pages.

The following directories are also required by the Django system:

- ``static/``

  - This directory contains non-user-generated media assets (for example:
    images, JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, etc).

- ``templates/``

  - This directory contains all the HTML templates for the Django system.

- ``locale/``

  - This directory contains translations required for the Django system.
    Translations for ``topics/`` are stored within the ``topics/content/``.

The following directories are used when the server is running (for example:
a script compiles the SCSS to CSS and saves it to the ``build/`` directory for
serving on a webpage).
You should never save anything in these directories, as the contents are often
overwritten and cleared.

- ``build/``

  - Contains the generated output of the front-end script (for example:
    compiled and minified CSS and JavaScript, compressed images, etc).

- ``temp/``

  - Contains temporary files used in creating generated files for
    ``build`` directory.

The ``csunplugged/`` directory also contains the following files:

- ``manage.py``

  - A file created by Django used to manage the Django web system.
    Don't modify the contents of this file.
