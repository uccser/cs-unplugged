Changelog
##############################################################################

This page lists updates to CS Unplugged.
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

.. note ::

  We base our numbering system from the guidelines at `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`_,
  for versions ``4.0.0-alpha.1`` onwards.

  Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.HOTFIX:

  - MAJOR version change when major backend or text modifications are made
    (for example: new topic).
  - MINOR version change when content or functionality is added or updated (for
    example: new videos, new activities, large number of text (typo/grammar) fixes).
  - HOTFIX version change when bug hotfixes are made (for example: fixing a typo).
  - A pre-release version is denoted by appending a hyphen and the alpha label
    followed by the pre-release version.

  As this project contains text content, the updating of content doesn't perfectly
  fit the Semantic Versioning model. However these version numbers can still
  provide a good indication of the changes in each version.
